A trope of mundane, harmless animal
turned into a monster:

The aim of "Killer Rabbit" archetype is 
to instill suspicion in players as
monster size and appearance can be deceiving:
Additionally, drawing and animating mundane
"glowing rabbits" is much similer than adding unique
monster types.

Mutant/Corrupted/Possessed animals that show
 up as ordinary until they attack are a variation
 of this design: usually the difference is 
 only perceived up close range, and if game 
 contained mundane versions of "Killer Rabbit"
the player would be guessing which is which.

Shapeshifting entities would be especially 
prone to use such disguise to avoid attention,
and serve as element of surprise to unsuspecting
players.
