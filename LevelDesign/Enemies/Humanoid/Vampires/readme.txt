Vampire:
A monster that is originally human(or alternatively sentient animal,humanoid alien, dependent on setting: only requirement being of similar looking species form) turning undead(demonic/high-undead), that feeds
on human blood, usually depicted with sharp teeth and pale skin.
Associated with bats, death, blood,night, decay and moonlight:
Vampire combines the qualities of a (night-time) predator and parasite: 
exhibiting supernatural powers, the vampire is vulnerable to mundane
objects and effects(sunlight), with particular methods ensuring its 'final' death. Vampires are a staple of horror, dark fantasy and paranormal fiction.
Recent fiction(e.g. Twilight) ascribe human qualities(emotional spectrum) to vampires, that is more appropriate to depict fae(fairies), this should be
avoided(though enemy NPCs can be more complex, dependent on setting: vampires
should not be an 'animal species' mimicing humans, like the skinwalkers ).

Alternative to vampires:
To avoid vampire cliches(or Twilight series references),
 they can be replaced by equivalent
 'disease-carrier' mutation(or in more abstract setting demonic possession/infection) that projects some threat toward the ordinary
inhabitant of the game world: the method of 'infectious conversion'(turning into a vampire) along with 'irreversible corruption'(vampires never returning to their pre-vampire species form)
that is inherent in the vampire archetype can be used to construct
fictional predator sub-species operating among the core species.
