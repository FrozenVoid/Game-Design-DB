Plateu is the most popular design for high-terrain levels, that is
 essentially change in elevation, separated by steep cliffs/chasm boundary or 
 mountain systems in each direction.
Plateaus avoid common pitfalls with vertical designs(player movement at incline, climbing,
pathing with varying heights,etc) by simplifying mountain areas in plateau hierarchies:
for more realistic design it is neccesary to add proper vertical transitions
(incline/climb paths) or pathing
which provides alternative means to ascent/descent 
mountains(steps/ropes/transportation devices/etc).
In general plateaus can be made realistic with minimal changes to overall design:
the players who don't like the provided pathing will be allowed to climb/descent 
at vertical transition points without damage(falling during exploring/discovery/etc),
but will lose time vs common pathing - the general idea will just converts 
some verticals into 45-60 degrees inclines which allow climbing.
