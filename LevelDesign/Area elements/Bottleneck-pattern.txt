Bottleneck pattern or chokepoint occurts where pathing is 
limited by level design:
A. wide path is suddenly forced into a small space("classic chokepoint") due
terrain shape.
B.Area x transitions to area Y within a narrow path("bottleneck entry point")
C.Functional chokepoint: the moving entities are slowed due environment(water,sand,
sticky terrain,lowering speed at the area as if there was a 'chokepoint') and unable
to change course with area boundaries preventing leaving the chokepoint path.
D.Interaction chokepoint: players interfere with each other while interacting
with object/npc where limited space is shared by many players,e.g. in a small room
or narrow path where normal movement is unobstructed in general.
