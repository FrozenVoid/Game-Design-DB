Timer is a event design pattern where some 
interaction triggers a timed area event,
usually quest-related task that has to be accomplished in time:
Area then sets a specific timer shown at top/bottom of screen to 
informa the player of the game mode change in the area.
Usually the quest/task is failed when condition is not met with 
timer expiring, but some designs allow to restart events.
