Island are defined as terrain surrounded by water bodies.
Smaller lake islands can be low-complexity design, but as scale grows
islands require more complexity:
At large scale islands can treated as miniature landforms with
all complexity that ensues with them, including geology/hydrology system.
Medium-scale islands also need:
1.Complex shores: different depths,causeways, reefs,sand banks,piers, cliffs,streams.
2.Water pathing; whirlpools, tidal paths/streams,lagoons, underwater canyons/ridges/mountains.
Archipelagoes can be imagined as transport hubs that control seas nearby.

3.Realistic vegetation; complex forest systems, high-density designs(island space is limited).
species on islands are isolated and unique variants.
4.Geology;  volcanic(island is based on central volcano, vertical complexity - appears isolated) 
vs organic(sediment,reefs, complex horizontal shapes - based on nearby terrain).
