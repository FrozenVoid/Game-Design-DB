Hydrological systems(water pathing included) is important differentiator in high-quality
level design, with more complex hydrology underpinning realistic physical design.
Realistic hydrology is often neglected, with games using flat terrain and linear rivers.
If a setting is even remotely realistic it has to follow physics-based hydrological design:
1.Curved rivers. Avoid linear rivers, they're just bland and boring canals.
2.Rivers/stream on different terrain levels: avoid flat terrain rivers. Add vertical
complexity: waterfalls, dams, canyons, dried out valleys,etc.
3.Lakes and ponds don't have to be spherical or semi-spherical reservoirs;
use odd shapes, lake islands/cliffs, peninsulas, sandbanks, bridges/piers liberally.
4.Complex shores: water bodies with simple linear shores are too artificial:
use zig-zags, protrusions, reefs, eminences, sharp cliffs, chasms and caves near shores.
5.No static weather and level: waves, storms, tides, floods,etc.
6.Smaller streams: for every larger river, there has to be at least a dozen tributrary streams feeding it.
Ideally a complex network of tree-like streams converge into a main river.
Don't avoid solitary small streams feeding ponds/chasms/etc they add sublime atmospheric 
of 'miniature scale levels' inside an area.
7.Diversity of bridges: natural bridges, rope bridges, logs, even rafts(or stepping stones),
avoid using a bridge system that is too large for the river(e.g. huge bridge vs tiny stream
 beneath it. Apply variety to bridge design, its a liminal area ripe with meaning as
  topological chokepoint for pathing on the level.
8.Deserts can have oasis areas, lakes and even rivers
(with green delta areas fading into sand/stone). Avoid 'water-less' design as it
appears completely unrealistic for a living world.
9.Springs,underground streams, wells,waterfalls: use a consistent approach for a single area,
define what its watertable height is, and where water goes vertically:
Underground areas have to be higher than watertable for navigation,
springs appear when watertable is high.
10.Imagine erosion: most 'unrealistic linear' designs don't have erosion.
Jagged edges and sharp curves are not compatible with large streams coming through(
though on smaller scale they add topographic complexity).
