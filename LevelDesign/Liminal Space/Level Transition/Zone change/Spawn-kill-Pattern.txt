Spawn-kill anti-pattern results from level design where.
1.Spawn area/Initial entry point is not set as neutral territory(disabling attacks from outside,
but not from inside).
2.Mobs/traps/debuffs/spells are allowed to enter spawn area.
3.Players character interacts with environment before level loads visually,
allowing little or none response time to surprise attack.
This phenomenon is exploited by PvP tactics such as 
"luring" - where players lure high-level monsters to spawn area
and "spawn camping" - placing traps/debuffs directly on spawn area.
The above tactics also apply where player spawns
via portals or generic waypoints.
