Zone change reset occurs where character arrives from another zone
indirectly(transport) or from portal, movement through zones usually does not.
The following attributes are commonly reset.
1.Character debuffs/buffs, including timed debuffs(e.g. poison/freeze/etc).
In some games character is healed and energy/mana/ammo is reset to default.
2.Summon status; non-permanent summons/pets are removed to storage.
3.Combat status: charges, modifiers and status effects are reset to pre-combat state.
4.(in non-neutral areas): monsters/traps are reset,
as interaction spawns new objects when
 the area is approached again.
 
 *Area-proximity resets can despawn monsters already set
 to change their random characteristics in next entry
 (such as weaker attributes) into the area/zone.
