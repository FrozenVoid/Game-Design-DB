Area entry Cinematics:
Usually displayed once(repeated area change cinematics are annoying).
The player reaching a new zone, before it loads will be shown
 'Area entry cinematics' that depict himself solving previous area quests
 and reaching to new zone/region.
Mostly such cinematics can be replaced by entry-area machinima,
with entry area in the zone serving as scripted tutorial/lore reveal sequence
which is more interactive than static cinematics(of course forcing repeat
of such area is even more annoying that skipping cinematics).
