Typically the player is notified with message in the center
 of screen like "Entering AreaName"
(such messages are superfluous and can be ommited for minor area
transitions)
 and environment loads(if not pre-loaded at border).
 for quest area longer messages are appropriate, telling 
 the player the local lore/rules/quest in non-modal fashion
 as scrolling text(infodump scroll).
 The player character in some settings may involuntary add
 a scripted comment/voice message 
 or react to new zone with pose/stance/emote.
