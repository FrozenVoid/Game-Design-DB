Corruption of an object subverts some fundamental quality
and adds element of decay/degeneration to project outward picture
of a negative process(even if the object of corruption is negative itself, corruption can't be a positive state as its generally used as proxy for presence of evil).
 Corruption of a place ensues when its fundamental
qualities are subverted and replaced by external values that
are incompatible with original qualities, 
but can mimic the appearance thereof or
 resemble its original form in some superficial way.
