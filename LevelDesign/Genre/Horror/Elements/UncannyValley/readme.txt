Uncanny Valley is a term for something appearing almost human-like:
e.g. a monster mimicing a human being as imposter.
Typical applications in a game would be deceiving the player 
about its nature, until it approached or interacted with.
Uncanny valley monster is visually similar to a human,
 but its movement/sound are different and under closer inspection
the human-like visuals are revealed to be distinct from humans(in-game).
To design an uncanny valley entity requires that a game provide
a very realistic, concrete human archetype that the "uncanny valley monster"
will subtly violate: the "uncanny valley difference" needs to be greater than
difference between in-game human and player internal model(the actual
uncanny valley that is erased by suspension of disbelief),
 in-game there is plenty of room to confuse
 objects by their visual design, especially with distance:
there is no need to make ultra-realistic "human monsters" as confusion
needs only to be temporary and superficial(to allow clear distinction).
