A fear of the unknown and general uncertainty of object's nature
is a the core mechanic behind 'horror mystery':
Games which reveal too much, leave less to work to imagination,
where 'horror' is constructed from scarce and conflicting information.
Player's knowledge of the game has to be revealed gradually,
without much direct exposition: focusing on hints, clues, lore metaphors
and providing indirect ways to deduce the truth is optimal(e.g. separating
the impossible from improbable).
Something being 'unknown' doesn't prevent constructing lore around it,
with player's naming/categorizing the 'Unknown' with their slang/vocabulary,
i.e. Cigarette Smoking Man in X-files, is never explicitly named or
described directly, the viewers learn about his nature as the story unfolds.
Horror games with unreliable, conflicting lore with ambigious interpretations
are best at keeping players guessing the true nature of game entities.
Infodumps, books,lore container/lore NPCs don't have to reveal 
anything but their limited perspective - the story itself will fill the gaps
as gameplay reveals new facts and hints to construct a more reliable
narrative independent of lore-based information.
The unknown, mystery element of design in horror is closest to 'paranormal
detective' sub-genre of detective fiction; in that case the player
is the inexpirienced protagonist turned against his will into
a mystery-search detective working against forces of the setting.
Unlike detective stories, where cases turn out to reveal complete information,
the horror mystery can remain partially unsolved or revealed to be a part
of something greater without much information being recovered about its nature:
the unknown simply retreats further into the mysterious fog of lore(
and giving potential for future sequels, of course).
