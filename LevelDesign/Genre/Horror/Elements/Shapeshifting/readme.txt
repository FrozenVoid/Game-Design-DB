Shapeshifting is a design which creates:
A.Original subject mundane form.
B.Alternative 'scary' representations.
C.Method to reveal/construct B from A.
The idea is to make B(scary form) compatible with A(mundane form),
so that shapeshifting subject will be seen as carrying
its original nature(A), like e.g. a zombie showing its former
human qualities. If e.g. a cat shapeshifting into an elephant,
it will be unrealistic looking process, that both entities can't
be linked to each other, whereas 'natural shapeshifting' allows
the player to discern the original form beneath the new shape.

Typical themes of shapeshifting:
1.Environment,walls,furniture,non-living objects:
when player doesn't look the environment changes to 
new shapes/design(confusing/menacing/surreal), non-living may become
living and living can turn to objects. Player's reality is in flux.
2.Characters(NPCs) change shape to another form or alter
their attributes. Player's social environment is in flux. 
3.Animals change to monsters. Can be emphasized with
specific influence and closeness to player character.
Player can't trust animals/nature.
4.Player character under the effect of curse/spell turns into another being.
Player can't trust the character avatar he commands.


Methods of reveal;
1.lightning reveals their new shapes, change is subtle.
Mirrors,stronger light-sources and focusing on the subject is essential.
Can be combined with 4 for slower reveal.
2.Player absence gives time to change, often combined with 4
and 'change under the cover of darkness/evil'
3.'jump scare'-type transformation, where shapeshifting
occurs as player view it.
4.gradual mutation/corruption is detected by examination of
subject shape/form.
5.Third-party reveal: the interaction of shapeshifting subject
with some third-party entity reveals its new nature.
