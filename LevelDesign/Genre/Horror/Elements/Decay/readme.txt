Horror genre uses decay as element of design to showcase
 negative atmosphere(implicit negative emotions)
 and increase in local evil/darkness.
 Decay is often used as proxy to represent 'death of a place', with abandoned/crumbling buildings: as a chracteristic of entire place,
permeating all objects and content - not as particular property of
something specific.

Types:
1.Material decay:Rust, rot,etc core material is transformed partially,
2.Geometric decay; erosion, worn out parts, broken parts.
core geometric shape is distorted(broken) or reduced in scope(skeletons, building frames, ship parts).
3.Surface decay: texture of 'decay' over material, e.g. spots,holes,burn marks,crevices, with core staying intact. 
4.Dynamic decay: decay occurs during gameplay, usually #3 or #1.
