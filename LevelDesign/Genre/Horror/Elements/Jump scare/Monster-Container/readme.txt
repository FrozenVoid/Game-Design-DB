Monster container is a design trope, where monster
is released from a container(aka 'Sealed Evil in a Can'),
where it was previously sealed('trap').
The release process can be a jump scare, if the plot 
neglects to mention the monster's presence in the container,
but ordinary containers (e.g. coffins,chests) can be
'trapped' as mechanic of surprise when character
opens them('Chest monster').
Subtypes;
A.Transformation container; the container was shapeshifted monster,
being revealed as player touches it or reveals its mimicry.
B.Appearance trigger:(usually more of a dark fantasy trope), monster is summoned/materialized
because player opened 'its container', as trigger to release it.
C.Burst out;"..and then a skeleton popped out". the monster
full form is expanded out of container seemingly inappropriate in size.
D.Nest reveal: container is broken and many smaller monsters escape out,
used with insects/worms/bats/snakes/etc to create a sense of unease as
area is revealed to host much more monsters than expected.
E.Portal drop: The container is actually a portal blocker that
allows monsters to escape when broken, e.g. a chest with portal inside.
F.Trapped room trigger object: the monsters emerge as container is moved or disturbed
from hidden room/area locations, as if it was a signal.
