Monster container is a design trope, where monster
is released from a container(aka 'Sealed Evil in a Can'),
where it was previously sealed('trap').
The release process can be a jump scare, if the plot 
neglects to mention the monster's presence in the container,
but ordinary containers (e.g. coffins,chests) can be
'trapped' as mechanic of surprise when character
opens them('Chest monster').
