Jump scare is a surprise encounter in horror games:
The idea is cliche enough so player mentally expect such jump scares
despite their effectiveness inversely proportional with their amount.
A 'jump scare' requires:
1.Surprise:unexpected/unknown presence is suddenly revealed.
A jump scare can be fake:e.g. a cat jumps out of darkness,
but player assumes its some terrible monster that have to be evaded at
all costs and runs away.

2.Malaise: player suspects something is about to happen, but can't
explain it('creepy feeling').
Game may hint with subtle changes in environment, lightning or sound,
however most games neglect to set/hint the player mood.

3.A jump scare is a singular expirience of its type;
If the game consists of jump scares, its design is flawed.
A proper 'jump scare' has to be unique, unexpected and in constrast with normal
 gameplay to be effective element of horror.

4.Not all settings are suitable for 'jump scares':
Trying to shove cheap jump scares everywhere will cheapen the overall 
level design of the game: e.g. a monster behind every door.


Alternatives:
Variations of a 'jump scare' are more effective in principle,
by triggering an unexpected reaction:
they are not considered
 'proper jump scares' but an surprise horror element related to
 the 'jump scare' tangentially as it may involve a 'reveal moment'
 in its expose sequence that is abstract 'visceral scare':
A.'Reverse jump scare'/'Loss of safety':
Revealing the vulnerable hidden character presence to enemies.
B.'Indirect jump scare'/'proof of presence':
Character suddenly revealed to a be monster/demon/etc in dramatic sequence.
Game may lend subtle hints to 'presence of evil' in character.
C.'Loss of stability'/'floor drop scare';
Character position is revealed to be unstable and collapsing,
falling suddenly through floor is most common variation.
Less common are handles, ropes and devices of transport/movement
failing mid-transportation(with character life linked to proper device function).
D.'temporary loss of sanity'/'sanity scare ';
Character pushed to breaking point shows signs of insanity, albeit temporary.
E.'living object scare'/"its's alive!"
Something that is not living is revealed to be alive, possibly
as grotesque corruption of something else.
E2.'robot reveal'; the reverse is something alive proven suddenly
to be a robot or artificial device,e.g. exposing wires.

F.'made of people'/'cannibalism scare';
A common 'reveal scare' where something is revealed to be made of(Soylent Green)
or requiring dead humans(or alternatively the protagonist species) 
to function.
Not neccessary food, but any device/system, 
e.g. Astronomicon in Warhammer40k being dependent on mass
psyker sacrifice suddenly being revealed
to a psyker ignorant of its function.
