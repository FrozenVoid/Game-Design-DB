A monster is revealed when character opens the door/portal/gate
to monster current location.

Subtypes:
1.Bat drop; character is assaulted as he steps into new room, from above
by monster hidden vertically from view, e.g. a bat on ceiling.

2.Just further back/Delayed reveal; monster isn't immediately seen, but is revealed to be
as character step further into the new room, usually hidden out of vision
range before the player views the entire room(assumed to be safe).

3.Behind the character: monster is actually following the player into
the room, as player examines the room:common extra effect is monster closing
the door behind the player..(While seemingly an inversion,
the monster is just hidden around the entrance area or arrives just in time).

4.Floor monster: the player opening the door allowing the monster to
slip in from below(e.g. a snake) as focus is on something in the distance.

5.Large entity reveal: the entire portal/gate/door is revealed to be occupied
with large organism trying to burst into the portal/gate/door.
