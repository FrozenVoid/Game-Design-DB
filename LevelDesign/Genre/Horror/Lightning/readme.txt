The horror genre uses lightning levels to obscure and distract
the player from danger. The typical horror design relies
on 'hidden danger' presence, which is delivered with:
1.Low lightning levels: intermittent/failing lights, unreliable/limited
lightning sources(e.g. candles),remote and insignificant sources
(fireflies,moonlight, starlight),
character needing to maintain the light to live, light-repelled monsters,etc.
Light is in horror should be quantified as vital 'survival metric' of setting;
where light has no penetration(e.g. depths below),
evil dwells and where light is plenty the
area is safe and secure - ergo, horror needs scarcity of light.
Sunlight at dawn/dusk, twilight, eclipse are potent
sources of symbolism for emanation of light/darkness.

2.Fog of war: player is kepts ignorant on what's going on, with literal fog
common in appropriate settings and abstract form of 'changes in the darkness':
where player not seeing something allows it to happen.
Light revealing something can be explained away as mundane, by contrast
things that occur in the dark are left to imagination.

3.Paranormal lightning: unexplained glowing objects, lights out of ground,
glowing entities,etc. lightsource that evade the viewer, dissappearing
when approached, illusory light,etc.

4.Shadows: absence of shadows(indicate non-physical entity), menacing shadows,
shadows separate from their source,shadows emanating darkness('dark light')
/ shadows as archetype of darkness,etc.

5.Sickly blue light:(not neccessary of blue color),a specific color like 
blue/red/yellow in lightning is used to alter appearance of a setting to create a specific
 atmosphere('sepia tones'), old school vibes('desaturation')
 and malaise(e.g. 'yellow tint'/'blue light skin').
Correct color distortion in reflection, side views can provide interesting
psychological effects, with refraction/reflection possible with newer game engines:
The common prismatic color banding can be altered with 'otherworldly' color ratios,
gamma/saturation tweaks,etc.

6.Lightning as signal: fireworks, flashlights, signal rockets, fires,torches,
symbolism of illumination as mastery over nature/darkness.
A scarcity of light sources creates a sense of dependence on technology and 
fear of losing progress in visceral "losing the light" sense, where
horror settings is depicting loss of humanity and civilization.
