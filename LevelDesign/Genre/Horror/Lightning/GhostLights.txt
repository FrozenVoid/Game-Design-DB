Ghost lights is a generic category for distant and faint
source of light appearing 'mysterious' and evading investigation.
The most common type is the "Will o' the wisp light" but any 
light source will do if it follows the rules;
1.Disappears if approached.
2.Slow and steady movement, no sharp change in pattern.
3.Provides faint, muted colors.
optionally, various sounds can be added to simulate a presence
of entity/spirit represented by the light.
