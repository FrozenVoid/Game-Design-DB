High fantasy(also epic/drama fantasy) is a genre that emphasizes the pathos 
and breadth of human experience(from a neutral point of view):

General rules:
The rules are not describing an average "fantasy" game, but
game design where high-fantasy settings manifests correctly.
Some high-fantasy tropes are not applicable due interactive
vs static media, but overall the static design will follow
a specific media source to dictate constraints of world 
settings and its themes, while organic design would 
use in-game lore to define the setting progressively
as lore is revealed.

1.Humor and sarcasm are kept sanitized or removed.
High-fantasy avoids puns, wordplay or crude jokes - unless 
 their presence is essential. Characters who are exhibiting
 sarcasm are portrayed as negative/antagonistic, with no
 cynical undertones of low-fantasy. Game themes which clash with
 high-fantasy ideals will be perceived as different or a sub-genre:
 before commiting into the genre conventions, consider alternatives.
 
1b.No compromise in plot to accomodate the player:
High-fantasy doesn't focus on minor details of events:
it leaves them in the background for the grand design, epic quests
 and world-shaping events. Plots are mostly
 linear with side-quests and distractions not influencing
 main storyline - while they can be complex and full of twists,
 only one path('one good ending'/'book ending and conclusion')
 resolves the storyline with multiple 'bad endings'(failure).
 Characters are serious and dedicated to the quest:
 there is no "playfullness/flexibility of opinion" of less strict genres.
High-fantasy distinguishes itself with these characteristics
and players will notice deviations from "high-to-low" which
would be dissonant in terms of aesthetics.

2.Only one path to success.
World is in crisis(Though not as deep as Dark Fantasy,
morality system is unchanging) and awaits its resolution.
Atmosphere is always emotionally charged and intense.
The setting can be described as "permanent quest/adventure":
there is no flexibility(though game may provide false paths)
or alternative routes to resolve the crisis.
Coherent, strict standard of aesthetic purity defines
most levels and events: the plotlines never explore 
"what if hero did something bad" situation, in the setting
 of the game there is no room for moral failure.
 
3.Heros don't have flaws or very minor flaws:
there are distinct 
sides in conflict - grey areas are not explored.
Players are not treated as heroes by their appearance, but reputation.
If a hero does have flaws he will either redeem himself or 
succumb to evil. Morality of heros is of great importance in 
high-fantasy: they have a strict code of honor, laws of the land
to abide and integrity of purpose.
General rules:
Heroes follow Virtue Ethics and rigid morality(Lawful Good)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics
Anti-heros may only follow "honor code" and often 
"honor before reason" ensues.(Lawful Neutral)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_system
Villains(Mostly Lawful Evil with Chaotic/Neutral Evil minions )
may use honor or virtue ethics
 against the hero: the antagonist will often mock the morality 
 system of the hero while keeping his own, but high-fantasy never 
 deconstructs or explores morality systems at depth(rigid morality system), 
 at least not anything that would question the hero's 
 integrity/commitment to the quest.
 

4.High-fantasy often utilizes folklore and legends by 
framing them in the overarching story. High-fantasy stories 
are very polished and refined "myth sequences" with
 structure described in the "Hero with a Thousand Faces"
from which few works deviate. Myth-makers building
 a coherent high-fantasy storyline will have inevitably come to use it.

5.Common experience is minimized to backstory: 
importance is given to plot events and overarching lore.
While high-fantasy does have a breadth of human expirience
 the plot never focuses on it and neither heros - they
generally do not "explore" all life options but observe it
 from a distance while following the quest.
High-fantasy(and its heros) does not need "complex human behavior"
or be a simulation of ancient life: most
 NPCs and plot points lack twists or depth.
Bathos in general is avoided or used for mockery and 
negative characteristics. High-fantasy never focuses on mundane effects.

6.Good 'ending' is not guaranteed, but hero will accomplish 
his goals. The more dramatic the story is, the less chance
 the hero will make it out alive.
High-fantasy doesn't utilize cliffhangers or 
cheap emotional tricks to entrap the players - its not a thriller film.
To avoid breaking genre boundaries try replaying the scenes
 of story multiple times to see their emotional effects:
high-fantasy doesn't twist the story for cheap thrills and
 "emotional jump scare effects" - its a serious,
 book-like plot that is neutral in character(neutral storyteller).
High-fantasy is not fast-paced but "strategic"
(heroes campaign to resolve crisis vs 
antagonist effort to restore status quo),
plot takes years or decades, with final resolution 
of quest not ending the story, but merely the start of final charter
 which depicts the world after the quest is over.
In general avoid using film structure and use book material.

7. Areas have defined moral character based on their
inhabitants or general mood of local setting(light vs dark,
depths and heights).
Music: epic instrumental and melancholic music is 
most fitting. Violins and pianos are best to reflect 
open world areas, with organs and heavy brass for interior.
Music often foreshadows events(like in film).

Studying mainstream high-fantasy like Lord of the Rings is essential to uncover
how the themes integrate with the setting: the common ground 'theme' of the world
and its areas are shaping the viewer perception of a setting
(immersion and acceptance of fictional world),
what aesthethics reveal about the character of a place, how the events are 
depicted in contrast with their background settings,
moral antagonism of systemic origin(Alignments, codes of honors,villain ethics;
depict specific traits of characters as if they were archetype of system:
the conflict can be both external and internal, as heroes moral system is
 tested to reveal weaknesses and flaws),etc.
 
Studying mythology and specifically epics/legends is essential to understand
the background and mentality of high-fantasy world:
the modern 'high-fantasy' evolution from the myth like Kalevala to complex
Lord of Rings setting requires deep understanding of cultural values 
and moral systems depicted(that are chronologically remote from us):
High-fantasy settings is not a copy
of something like religious mythology but a construct that uses mythology
as core of the setting to establish fundamental values and lexicon of
the world created, with cultural depth coming later(function vs interface):
the design of high-fantasy is more appropriate for 'build-by-book' technique
vs improvisation on theme:
Common mistakes where high-fantasy disconnects from mythological basis:
A.Game uses tropes Clashing with established tropes and 
conventions of style.
Tropes that define high-fantasy cannot be removed/deconstructed
without compromising the game's genre.

B.Game is Projecting current cultural values to
the mythological setting underpinning the high-fantasy
world. Use a specific, singular setting that defines
the culture without appropriating cultural trends/fads.

C.Game is using concepts/terms of Modern design,
instead adapt 'ancient lexicon' to depict something.
Language of setting has to be consistent with its tech level
and unexpected technological/cultural novelties have to be redesigned.

Clashing, Projecting and Overly Modern design will create
a dissonant expirience that will not be high-fantasy,
merely fantasy or sci-fi(if too modern) with 
heavy emphasis on high-fantasy tropes(space operas,soft sci-fi,paranormal fiction,
steampunk/x-Punk,etc which
already have their own genre conventions that don't require high-fantasy
rulesets to be followed), a hybrid of genres that isn't good enough for both.
