Usually a game uses different enemy levels for areas
connected in the overworld layer - it prevents travel by 
low-level players for most of the game world.
Depth level system operates by making all enemies on
the same depth around the same level(as used in dungeon crawlers);
example;

Overworld; level 1 enemies
depth +1(e.g. cave); level 2-4 enemies
depth +2;level 5-7 enemies
depth +3;level 8-10 enemies
depth +4;level 11-15 enemies

Advantages:
Exponentially increases amount of space to travel and explore
for low-level characters.
Possibility to separate servers for each depth,
as inter-level transition for players.
Removes most level balance issues by separating
high-level threats from low-level players with depth.
