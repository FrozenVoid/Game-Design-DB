As a player "plays" Mario he is unaware
of being a marionette trained by Mario Bros. 
 game engine: the 'muscle memory' claimed
 to be purely reflexive is actually several
layers of game engine influence as game
 mechanisms are ingrained in players mind.

1.Basal: 'Fight or flight' reinforcement,
player is under (replacement) stress of quick
 decision to survive in virtual form.
This competes with real-life instincts and
 emotional states, as games offer instant 
 feedback and rewards. Brainwave synchronization
 with beta/gamma states(frame rate) create 
 activation of higher-level brain areas,
 corresponding to deep focus and mental concentration,
 along with stress and anxiety.
 

2.Warped perception: Game engine reinforces 
its own reality model that deceives the senses
inside the 'suspension of disbelief' framework,
as player under this state can be compared
to one under hypnotic trance - all attention is
focused on game mechanics and immediate short-term
goals.

3.Goal substitution: the player goals shift
to optimize in-game performance, at expense 
of real-life events. The deprioritization of 
real-life concerns is psychologically connected
with 'escapism' philosophy(replacement stress and 
 goal substitution allow to disconnect from toxic
 environments).

4.Self-identity mutation: player treats his
avatar and in-game resources as more important
than they are, sacrificing real for virtual power.
The metamorphosis is fueled by low self-respect
and identity seeking within a world of instant
feedback.

5. Escapist fantasies: player ideas of home
and identity are hijacked by game engine to
resemble in-game objects and locations.
The rapport with virtual entities grows stronger,
their qualities(artificial) constrasted with 
physical entities and processes.

6.Immersion addiction: the player goals shift
from in-game objectives into psychological 
comfort-seeking by immersion, gaming as 
process becoming a valuable reward from standpoint
of escapism.
