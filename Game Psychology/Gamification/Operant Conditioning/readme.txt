Using gamification techniques its also possible to apply
operant conditioning to real-life tasks:


Negative conditioning, ("avoidance pattern") can be easily trained with pain stimulus.
Example:
1.You make a mistake.
2.Kick yourself lightly or add pain/unpleasant expirience.
Unpleasant tasks can a substitute.
3.The brain will associate pain with the mistake.
4.After a few repeats of procedure,
the brain will try reflexively to prevent pain/task/expirience.
5.Pattern learned.

Positive conditioning, ("reward-seeking pattern") 
is harder, due reward being in your control.
1.you accomplish some task.
2.Give yourself a reward. Preferably the reward should
not consist of something you usually get 
or can give yourself at will - this negates the power of conditioning.
3.The brain will associate reward with the accomplishment.
4.After a few repeats of procedure, 
the brain will seek the reward and promote ways to  accomplish something.
5.Pattern learned.
