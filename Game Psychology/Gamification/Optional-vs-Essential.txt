Products, activities and things can be 
either Optional(leisure/hobby) or 
Essential(bringing one closer to goals or achievements).
Prioritizing most essential things first is critical 
to making progress, while keeping 
Optional things
to minimum ensures they don't overtake your limited time:
However it is the Optional things that bring
satisfaction and fullfillment due control of the 
user over the choices/decisions that are static
with Essential(mandatory choices) feeling as routine.
