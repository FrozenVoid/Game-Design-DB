Gamification of content is a psychological strategy that adds competitive metrics to
application/system functionality, rewarding users with virtual points/currency
for completing tasks dependent on their performance.
In essence gamification creates a statistical overhaul of a system where each element
of user interaction is turned into a metric where user competes among his peers:
usually this involves ratings/ranks, points and rewards that give incentive
to perform vs rigid/static stimulus like salary/bonus.
Not all game design patterns are suited for gamification, but the system which is
being gamified can be adapted itself to create a platform on which gamification can be
constructed, conceptualizing new performance metrics as game rewards.
Criticisms of gamification usually tend to point these factors;
1.Hypercompetitive atmosphere of gaming in the workplace creates a dysfunctional
'cutthroat culture' where users sabotage each other effort to ensure their rating/metrics 
are the best locally.
2.Bad actors exploiting gaps and weak points in gamification to advance their metrics
above their actual performance on the task being gamified(i.e. similar to game exploits
 using systemic weak spots to gain advantages).
Both can be easily discouraged by refining the metrics to ensure fairness at all levels:
Usually the system will incorporate social metrics(reputation/kudos/etc) to allow
other users to provide an estimate for 'fairness metric' for a specific user,which is then
 averaged and applied to his achievements as counter-balance to hyper-competitive/exploiting 
  'gamers' eager to find unfair ways to get advantages.
