Types of E/R situations:
Timesink - low-effort low-reward (e.g. entertainment)
Timesinks are insidiously deceptive as 
low-effort adds up and time spent can be used elsewhere.

Hobby  - High-effort low-reward (e.g. painting/writing)
Hobbies can train skills but require disproportionate time 
investment for their result.

Task - Low-effort High-reward (e.g. fixing something)
Tasks are immediate quick fixes for problems or goals,
which have high-reward ratio but don't train much skill

Job - High-effort High-reward 
Jobs are longer-term tasks which cultivate skill 
and have a definite reward/result.
