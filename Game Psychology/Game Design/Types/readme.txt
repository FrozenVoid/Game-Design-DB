General overvier of game design approaches:

The Idea Man - You have vague, general ideas but don't like to spend time
on details, however you want to get technical in some cases

The Critic - You need some template game to critique and improve piece by 
piece

The Micromanager - You want to design the game from the ground up without
missing any detail

The Artist - you have an artistic vision and want to concentrate on
form over function, bringing your style and cultural concepts into a
 template game.

The Inventor - you want to implement exotic, complex and novel ideas
 that didn't appear in a game before or were not explored fully

The Modder - you have exact type of game you like and want to modify
 it easily without concentrating on details until its required.

The Producer - you need to create a random games of similar design
at lowest development time, details will be fixed later: ideas should be
 simple and clear.
