Agency refers to amount of control by player inside the
videogame world, not to be confused with "roleplaying"
(agency doesn't require roleplaying).

Agency requires:
1.Low latency communication: instant feedback on user action.
2.Smooth agent movement on screen, lack of jerkiness.
3.User-friendly control interface: interface that doesn't impede 
the player-character link.
4.lack of autonomous action: the character doesn't surprise the player
with scripted/forced actions or unexpected choices.
5.Player's choice is predominant in story: a linear game design decreases agency("on rails") while open world/sandbox
type games increase it.
6.Game doesn't force specific storyline or task as blocking progress.
