Chance-based interactions reduce agency by
adding risk/reward mechanics or an unexpected result.

Types of chance-based designs:
1. Range of possibility:
A "n% chance to X" statistic simulates probability
of some action succeeding as intuitive 'chance->effect'.
This design doesn't affect immersion and can be
considered most intuitive for player(probability chances).

2. Random roll stat:
e.g. sword with 6-20 damage giving 7 damage.
This simulates random effort or effect in specific range.
This reduces immersion in some aspects, but doesn't
violate interaction realism if the min-max range is
limited: e.g. a 1-1000 damage spell is 'too random'.
High uncertainty in stat values creates hidden
distrust towards game mechanics, and will eventually
lower immersion as RNG numbers start affecting
obvious results(e.g. prolonging combat,unexpected damage).


3. Random content item(lootbox/bundle/hidden reward):
A game interaction gives some container to player which he 
opens and received a random reward.
Immersion is not affected if the reward is unexpected,
but most such schemes give mundane and expected awards
(junk items, low-quality resources, game tokens/currency)
which is treated as gambling interface(easily repeated
 container purchase/reward interaction) that looks
as artificial and repetitive segment without place 
in the overall game.
 
 
 
3a.Random loot: the common RPG paradigm of assigning some
chances to get specific items in a combat interaction
(defeat of monster/opening a guarded container/random quest reward)
Random loot is ingrained as 'acceptable form' of gambling,
where monsters/chests are treated as magical pinatas with
random loot production organized into 'farming areas' by
high-level players that 'gamble time' for 'random items':
essentially high-level gaming devolves into 'loot runs'
to refill item collections,i.e. gaming with purely economic reasons.
This breaks immersion gradually as game activity 
reforms towards optimizing characters for 
'farming areas', treating them as tools.
