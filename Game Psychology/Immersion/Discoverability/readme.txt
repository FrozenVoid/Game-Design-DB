Discoverability https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoverability
Is a feature of a game that enables a player to find 
relevant information without using external software(i.e.
not using a website, software tool,etc).

In particular, hiding game content/info as 'mystery'
or 'hidden mechanic'
to enhance "realism" actually breaks immersion as players
search for answers outside the game.

Information that cannot be discovered in game forces
players to consults external sources during gameplay,
which break immersion and paints the character of the game
world as "artificially constructed" as player meta-game their
character(min-maxing, crafting, stretegies) to optimize stats.

Example: a game has a hidden crafting recipe, but
only those reading a game-related website can find it.
By moving to a browser and searching this piece of information,
the character of 'hidden recipe' is discovered outside and
is mentally disconnected from the game: the 'hidden recipe'
become a meta-game cheat separating casual gamers(who don't
research the game deeply, however are easily immersed)
and dedicated gamers(who meta-game 
and research, but lack immersion).
If such a recipe was available in-game, the need to 
meta-game/search/planning would be reduced,
allowing
both groups to enjoy immersion without inter-group animosity.
