Explorability is a measure of freedom of exploration
available to a player. Types:
1.World exploration: movement and transportation,
lack of arbitrary boundaries.
2.Experimentation with game mechanics:
exotice builds, combinations, recipe and strategies.

Common anti-patterns reducing exploratibility:
1.Invisible fences: level boundaries limit exploration
due lack of content, bad boundary design or specific requirements.
2.Locked doors: gatekeeping game content until player reaches
some objective or achievement(non-quest).
3.Zero-fault mechanics: there is only one way to do X, and large
penalties otherwise.
4.Maintaince budgets: player has to track his resources
during exploration, as they determine his success.
5.Empty levels/Content desert:
static sparsely-populated environment 
and no incentive to explore limited content.
6.Limited interactions for unlimited risk:
game doesn't reward risk-taking and exploration.
