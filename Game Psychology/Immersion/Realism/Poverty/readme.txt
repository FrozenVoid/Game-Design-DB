Poverty in video games is depicted as static class
of NPC quality('poor NPC X'), with common depiction(outside of horror games),
emphasizing some moral value in 'being poor' and
'connected to reality'. Poor NPCs usually look
just like 'Hollywod ugly' depiction of ugly people:
the intent is often to provide some 'down to Earth' persona
that is powerless due plot of the game.
Games don't want to alienate players with realistic
consequences of poverty on NPC mind and opt for depicting
some 'worn out' character than is out of luck('unlucky NPC' trope
is fairly common in gaming).
Character transformations of NPC turning to poverty state are
usually absent, with most visual characteristics and mannerisms
indicating some 'external quality' to expirience, as if abstract
events with some remote influence and not the entire NPC lifestyle
breaking down due poverty. The economic situation often lacks depth
and depicted as single variable property for every 'poor NPC',
who will instantly become 'rich NPC' if the variable is increased by X.
The games which explore mental degeneration and desperation
of poverty state
are fairly rare and confined to games where post-apocalyptic
/survival(e.g. horror) elements turn everyone to 'poor NPCs'
due economy not existing or being irrelevant:
actual poverty with 'contrast of class' is avoided in most cases
(games are usually written with assumption of inherent moral values 
of capitalist system that treats poor as 'scum of society'
or 'undesirable useless eaters/welfare class').
