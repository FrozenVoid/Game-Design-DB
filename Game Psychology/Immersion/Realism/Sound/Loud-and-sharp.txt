Loud and sharp sounds have a jarring effect and 
are considered a nuisance if repeated in any substantial quantity.
A good design would limit volume of sounds, reduce
contrast and avoid sounds which are unusual in the settings.
Horror genre games tend to abuse the 'surprise sound'(loud and sharp)
pattern to induce a cheap emotional scare or disturb the player;
while this technique is effective, it cheapens the game quality,
with more subtle alternatives giving more effect:
allowing imagination of players to construct a scenario is more
flexible and potent way as "a whisper is louder than a shout".
