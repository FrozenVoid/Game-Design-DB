Gore is a realistic depiction of combat/death/wounding and similar 'realistic damage'
effects that is especially potent at provoking psychological reaction but long-term gore 
has anti-immersive consequences making game expirience too jarring/realistic to players(immersion is not realism), warping player's psychology and worldview.
There are several factors that make gore anti-immersive and corrupting for video game expirience:

1.Despite realism, the sheer focus on gore tranforms the game expirience into
a film-like event, where actions of player trigger apperance of gore effects.
The immersion of game is ruined when realism clashes with player expectations or beliefs:
the player shock/disgust wears off and gore is perceived as unneccessary and distracting special effect.

2.DIsgust from seemingly virtual events translates into disgust of the game itself.
Game visuals are strongly associated with least appealing content, with gore being near the bottom on
appeal scale(with exception of some psychopaths).

3.The uncanny valley phenomenon where almost-real gore is both repulsive and unrealistic:
The game creating a deliberate 'extra gore' effect, physics interactions and sound effects will
create a disconcerting atmosphere that turns the game into a creepy simulation of real gore.

4.Players are mentally traumatized with virtual gore since the visuals remind them
of their own mortal nature and susceptibility to damage,death and pain - it would however
 take substantial time for most to internalize the idea, which is that game is promoting
negative psychological anchors in its depiction of gore(especially with omnipresent combat/death).

5.'Videogame violence' arguments mostly stem from realistic depiction of gore:
the desensitization of exposure to gore creates a decrease in empathy and dissoaciation
with depicted content, often rationalizing it as virtual - unlike visual media such as film, where
people don't interact with content, the player-created content is intentional choice:
the psychology of player who 'wants to see gore' is aided by its easy availability in game
 and lack of social stigma towards such games(due opposition to censorship).
5A.While 'gore' is virtual, the psychological consequence of viewing visual media are
concrete and long-lasting impression on the player mind. This argument is especially potent
due early brain development in children absorbing values/culture of environment,in that case
being violent, gore-filled videogames which are promoted as 'extreme adult expirience' for children
unable to form value judgements due inexpirience.

5B.Games often use gore to promote some 'realistic' expirience gained by gamers, often steeped
in atmosphere of hypermasculinity, extreme violence and military pathos(e.g. war simulation).
The game depicting gore isn't merely using it as 'piece of realism' but as tool to create a social
structure where its normalized and integrated as 'fact of life'.

5C.Such realistic expirience promotes psychopathic tendencies among susceptible individuals,
which in turn devalues social mechanisms of conflict-avoidance in favor of material superiority and domination, treating weakness as inferiority: the hierarchies of power in gaming are translated to real-life situations that evoke desensitization from rigid videogame interactions, creating psychopathic
gamer-mentality(hyper-competitive, non-compromising,min-maxing and system-exploting tendencies) which treats the world as real-life videogame and humans as robotic NPCs.
