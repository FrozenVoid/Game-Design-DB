Depiction of death, while common due combat-centric games 
dominating the industry is often unrealistic or abstract:
the reason is obviously a strong avoidance of the subject itself
by players.
The subject brings unpleasant questions on player mortality,
the corpses provoke disgust and fear of death.
Most games opt out of depicting realistic 'death scenes' instead
using abstract 'damage indicators' and disappearing corpses to reduce
 visceral emotions during simulated combat.
In general less death-signifiers will create a better atmosphere
even for the darkest/hardcorest meat-grinder game, 
since constant death references are harmful to 
human psychological state(humans are emotionally fragile).
THe methods to avoid death depictions usually take the following form:
1.Removing corpses of enemies after a small period.
This reduces further ruminating/guilt from player actions.
2.Using static, standard corpses without damage indicators.
This avoids disgust and attention to a specific death:
everything is too standardized and artificial to be 'real'.
3.Damage indicators removed after game death
(corpses don't exhibit further damage/bleeding).
Players don't feel repulsed by their action's effect.
4.Limiting and standartizing sound/gore effects during combat.
Realistic combat/horror games will try to probe the boundaries
but will not want to alienate their 'hardcore' market, opting for 
user-friendly expiriences with minimal disgust/discomfort/guilt:
this means the expirience will tend to exhibit a 'factory model of death':
each death of same type will be exactly the same visual/aural expirience
 leaving the gameplay process in the player as repeating background element
 that only amplifies the 'hardcore' aspect of atmosphere but otherwise a mundane
 event that has no unique expiriental quality.
