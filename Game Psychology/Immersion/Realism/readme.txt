Realism is not equivalent to immersion. 

Realism is a stylistic design choice that
can aid immersion by anticipating player expectations of game world:
by itself realism only provides technical accuracy(depiction of real-world)
that can be used to construct an immersive expirience but such technical accuracy
only works in favor of realistic settings;

i.e. "realism" is a functional(visual/aural/physics effects) quality of
specific realistic setting(true to setting), mimicing some 
aspects of reality while ignoring others.

immersion is a psychological quality of the game process itself,
e.g. acceptance of response/reward mechanics, psychological comfort, 
suspension of disbelief(this is aided by being 'true to setting', which in realistic settings
implies accurate depiction of 'realism')
