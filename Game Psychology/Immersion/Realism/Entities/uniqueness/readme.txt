an entity in video game is usually a clone of its type:
this makes the game appear unrealistic.
To make such entities unique is to make its components
 flexible range variables;
1.Visual templates with random variables; e.g. height 0.95-1.05
2.Entity variable ranges;e.g. speed is 1.00-1.05
3.AI script variations; parameters of AI-guided entity are different
for each entity, but follow entity-type range of allowed values.
4.Variable bonus attributes/ability; e.g. another skill(from allowed random skills)
5.Environmental influence; entity receives bonus/malus from environment
variables(e.g. lava boosts fire spells, ice lowers fire power,trees spread fire),
so each interaction depends on current terrain/weather and static objects(e.g. trees)
6.Energy meters for interaction; is the entity exhausted/low on mana/hp?
A more character-like set of variables like stamina/hp/mana/energy can
be used to model more complex behavior, where it would alter
entity variables(e.g. speed).
7.Adaptation; can the AI script change tactics based on entity
current variables(hp/energy), alter skill use to match opponent(e.g. alter selected skill based on distance to player)?
