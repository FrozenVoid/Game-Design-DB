Food inside videogames is mostly anti-immersive, especially if realistic:
1.Food reminds players of their food preferences and provokes judgement.
2.Food can be deemed repulsive due player dietary restrictions.
3.Food and drink are associated with bodily functions and weight.
4.Foods added for 'realism' in game context can provoke disgust due preparation or its nature.
5.Games that abuse hunger/thirst mechanics add extra stress for player managing the character.
In general food in game can be replaced by non-food magical consumables/abstract potions of X
which would serve as neutral 'food'/'resource' and mechanics encouraging realism
(food as resource) should be replaced by 'magic resources' for more flexible system:
e.g. allowing to unrealistically create 'food-like resource' by magic.
