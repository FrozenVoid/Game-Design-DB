Realistic depiction of insanity would be disturbing for
most of players, with game providing various character cues
to indirectly depict insanity/dementia/mental illness as a phenomenon.
Types of insanity commonly depicted:
1.NPC possessed by evil forces. The insanity is explained away by
using the NPC as proxy for enemy/evil influence.
2.Not quite sane NPC: game provides various cues to the player which
make him doubt the sanity of specific NPC, without directly showing 
such behavior.
3.Insane Clown: a 'insane' NPC is depicted as chaotic clown-like 
figure that seeks negative reactions from audience to showcase some
social flaw or weakness of character.
4.Psychopathic killer: a 'killer' NPC motivation is explained as
psychopathy and decline in sanity, with some traumatic/dramatic background
story used to justify his actions.
5.visionary gone mad: A npc who looked 'through the veil' far enough
 to be corrupted by forces behind it, but in his mad speech leaving hints
 on some lore content as exposition.

Most games will not depict psychological disorders with realism,
as such depictions will provoke disgust and discomfort without meshing
with typical game role of 'insane NPC' or not providing any useful purpose:
an exception might be horror games which depict asylums and psychiatric medicine,
which would intentionally provoke visceral repulsion of the subject for
some 'realistic' effect, usually as 'insane enemies chasing/attacking the player'.
