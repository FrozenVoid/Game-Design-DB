Disgust is a potent visual/aural cue that
reduces immersion:
THe mechanism for immersion breaking is as following.
1.A realistic depiction of disgusting object(e.g. a parasite)
is encountered in game process.
2.Disgust and avoidance of diseases is deeply ingrained evolutionary trait.
Immersion depends on the game process not provoking avoidance of the game content:
unlike avoidance of game objects themself, content quality is
inherent game property viewed 'as designed', with player accepting
or rejecting certain design choices strictly related to how well
the content quality meshes with player expectations:
When player is 'surprised by disgust' he knows this design choice
was intentional by game content creators.

3.Player is thrown out of 'suspension of disbelief' by encountering
 a visceral emotion that he can attribute to the game quality:
 regaredless of how realistic and appropriate it is to 
 feel disgust at something, the emotion is generalized to the entire game.
4.Player subconsciously views the game as source of his emotion,
 mapping location-of-emotion to the game world:
 At this point the realism of the game starts working against it,
 with player avoiding triggering/viewing 'realistic' disgust-objects
 and reduce exposure to negative feelings.
 5.Player devalues his gameplay commitment by avoiding playing the
 game, which is subconsciously viewed as 'disgusting', like if
  the game was an unpleasant horror film.
