Complexity of game interaction influences the
immersive qualities of game world.
Common design mistakes:
1.Optimization in favor of experts vs intuitive design:
complex, rich interfaces that require expertise and
meta-game knowledge to use optimally.
Simplicity, intuitive design and speed of interaction
are often sacrificed to answer some technical problem,
despite providing mundane functionality used all the time.

2.Multi-level interactions: bringing different 
aspects of the game into a single interaction that
cheapens immersion due mixing different parts of interface,
which switch modes of interaction within player perception.

3.Zero-tolerance process: interactions that are final and
have far-reaching effects available in a few clicks:
no fail-safes, rollbacks or requirement/confirmations.

4.Lack of customization: complexity cannot be reduced
with hotkeys, custom menus or interface options.
Irreducible complexity of common game actions leads
to "macro" meta-game tools, bots and scripts which 
remove routine complexity and automate dull, repeating actions.
