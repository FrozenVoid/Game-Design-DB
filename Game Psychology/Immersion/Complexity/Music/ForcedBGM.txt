in a immersive setting with environmental
sound sources and dynamic, moving sound generators
(incl. particle sounds), Background music
will distract from in-world immersion:
Music that does fit an environment could be unobtrusive
but will sound artificially inserted
and mood-forcing element that is ingenuine
and lacks felxibility to response to actual
"mood of the player's world".
