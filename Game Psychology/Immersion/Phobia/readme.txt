Phobias are common psychological disorders which
involve pathological fear and avoidance of some subject;
a person afraid of slithering snakes has snakephobia
(ophidiophobia per official terminology).
Many such phobias have roots in deep evolutionary past
where e.g. 'pathological fear of snakes' 
was perfectly justified and contributed
to better survival chances of the species.

Games which depicts the subject of phobia will either
be accepted or rejected by phobic people dependent on
kind of 'realism' the subject is depicted as in-game.
If e.g. a person deathly afraid of snakes encounters
 abstrast 'game snake' with predictable playful movement and color
 pattern it would actually lessen the phobia, but if
 the snake is unpredictable, suprisingly realistic and
 hostile the phobia will be triggered, at least subconsciously:
 attempting to play the game will create a state of psychological
 discomfort/malaise, even if the fear itself is overcome.

Abstract/fantasy creatures are perfectly capable of
triggering phobias and visceral emotion if the phobic associates
them with real subjects of phobia. While attempting
to rid the game of all phobias is futile, a brief look
at common phobias(with at least 4-10% prevalence in audience)
will prevent game design inadvertedly stumbling on some
game part which many players will hate the game for later:
e.g. with high-prevalence of phobia of spiders(arachnophobia),
will the game fare better if spiders were replaced by
different enemy set? Can spider-based location be redesigned 
without spiders? What spider-related mechanics can be removed?
