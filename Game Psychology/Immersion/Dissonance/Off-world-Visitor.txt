The setting of off-world visitor fantasy( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai )
is a potent source of dissonance, where contemporary culture/ideas/technology
clash with fantasy settings in which the (usually contemporary stand-in for the player)
protagonist is inserted and operated by player.
While the setting is intentionally mixed-genre, it doesn't escape stylistic
critique: it is often as cheap self-insert fantasy justified by magic/technology,
which exploits the player's desire of 'hero roleplay' with various rationalizations
that improve suspension of disbelief at cost of increased dissonance,
i.e. the setting is tailor-made for rationalization of fantasy roleplaying but
doesn't provide the 'real-world' setting itself(expecting every player to relate
to his own reality as basis,
which is provided in anime/manga as another fictional world)
or set any constraints to this 'kitchen-sink amalgamation' 
of real and fantastic,
operating on player/viewer ad-hoc fantasy roleplay as
basis for building the game script.
Litmus test for consistency: Imagine the isekai setting in 100 years in the future, what
would player from that period think of 'isekai real world'(from which the protagonist
is taken to fantasy world)?

vs Fantasy roleplaying game:
The difference between isekai fantasy and a player in a fantasy MMORPG/RPG,
is that the former genre implies the connected world of 'reality'/'fantasy'
while the latter is imagined as isolated setting that is independent of real world:
i.e. isekai(off-world visitor fantasy) setting is intentionally blurring
the boundary between fantasy and reality that from outside looks like exploiting
the psychology of 'player power trip' and rationalization thereof that is absent
in pure fantasy setting that is designed without this 'off-world visitor' in mind:
in a fantasy game, player is forced to adopt a fictional fantasy persona created
from the ground up and without any hints of reality(a setting close to isekei raincarnations),
in isekai he is merely set as "real visitor" into the 'game world', in
which 'game world' is essentially a subservient extension of the 'real world'
 that is inferior in power and scope - a major source of dissonance that
 is absent in time-travel fantasies(due both time periods being from same basis setting).
 
 vs Lucid dreaming:
The genre has parallels with lucid dreaming, especially with "fantasy" worlds
of astral origin that dreamer can access or imagine during a dream.
Isekai worlds have a similar 'dreamer-centered' power hierarchy where anchoring of being
in a real world transcends the laws of 'dream world' and rewrites its reality
by sheer force of will. The 'power trip' expirienced by lucid dreamers 
when they realize they have no constraints is eerily similar to overpowered
heroes of isekai fantasy('nothing to lose but time'), who have no care or special
reverence for their new home world.
