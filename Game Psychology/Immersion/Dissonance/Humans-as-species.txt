Depicting humans as part of fictional world(e.g. Sci-Fi) can lead
to dissonance due their 'real world' category clashing
with player expectation of what a 'human being' is.
Games often try to avoid directly referencing the species
of the 'human being' as humans,
making them 'terrans','humanoids' with
some connection to Earth,'future human species' etc but
such attempts inevitably get viewed by players are stand-in for current
real-world humans. Humans anthropomorphize anything remotely human-like,
with species taking human character and traits expected of human beings:
Trying to design something 'human-like species,
but really whatever we want' will be judged
as 'humans, in author's interpretation' allowing any 
issues with human politics/society/psychology/sexuality to dominate
game discussion, neglecting actual lore/background in favor of 
transference of real-world issues to fictional-world setting.
Many are unable to cope with the idea that authors of 
fictional settings will not focus on their pet issues or worldview,
instead opting for game-centric lore that neglects 'human issues' as
 species in players eyes will be a carbon copy of humanity with different
 visuals, so they have to get the same social issues/problems despite
 being entirely fictional subjects in a world driven by plot.
The problem persists with any anthropomorphic species that has
human aspects(complex emotions, society,etc) with immersion dependent
on settings species both being 'socially realistic' and 'faithful to lore':
The design has to accomodate inherent expectation of what
player expect of 'human-like species' and pre-emptively fill in lore gaps
that can be connected to real-world issues(e.g. if game X doesn't have lore
explanation of Y, Y will be inevitably decided to be the same as real-world Y).
