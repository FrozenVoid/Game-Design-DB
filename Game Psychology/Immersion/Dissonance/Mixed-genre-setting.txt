A mixed-genre setting is a forced amalgamation of distinct and often incompatible
genres that manifest into a hybrid setting known as 'Fantasy kitchen-sink'.
Usually the idea(kitchen-sink approach) simplifies design as cost of induced dissonance,
by relaxing genre constraints,style guides or rulesets to introduce new elements
without bothering to check consistency and compatibility with old elements:
this creates a mixed-genre setting where dominant background setting(usually
some 'ancient world') is mixed with technologically advanced industrial objects:
the background setting isn't transformed or upgraded, just mixed with new elements.
