A game storyline repeating is common with games
having a flat, linear storyline forcing players
to repeat all quests/tasks/challenges/bosses each time to
advance a new character: this creates a strong anti-pathy
for repeating elements, making the completion of tasks
similar to a mandatory chore, which ruins immersion.

solutions:
A.non-linear storylines: with a hefty design investment
its possible to create localized/personalized paths
with multiple-choice splits storyline.
it doesn't solve the immersion problem(as content still repeats)
, but provides variety in player choice.
B.Optional tasks/quests: games can opt out of forcing
the player to follow the storyline, instead allowing free open-world
exploration and opt-in quests(usually localized to area/NPC).

C.No storyline/player-driven storyline:
turning the concept on its head, the players actions are 
instead defined as the 'storyline' with the game documenting
his progress without forcing a quest/task system:
few games implement this idea well, instead migrating
quest/tasks into "achievement" mechanics - however 
a quest/task system can be eliminated completely in favor
of 'static world' approach which scale better for multiplayer.
