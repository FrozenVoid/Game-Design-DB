Theme mismatch occurs where two objects have different themes
in their design; The dissonance occurs where either A or B object violates
the player expectation of game theme:
Examples:
1.Sharp differences in appearance style, quality or visual structure.
Player expect a consistent apperance of in-game content at specific location.

2.Incoherent application of game rules that makes A or B a messy exception,
creating its own specific rules/themes inside the game.
example;item-specific unique mechanics
 
3.Disconnect with overall game mechanics, out of place/unique features that
clash with similar objects:e.g. location-based rule changes, attributes that override
 other attributes or modify them unexpectedly.
3b.Location-specific game functionality that is not used elsewhere outside the level or its type.
e.g. vertical levels/climbing mode, underwater-only equipment/tools/skills.

4.Inconsistency in design that manifests in duplicate but differrent functionality,
confusing players, adding extra levels of indirection to features, applying functionality
dependent on context,etc.

5.Unwarranted complexity of interaction; creating specific algorithms, rules and techniques
 to perform simple tasks, then allowing shortcuts to use them.

6.Visuals that create impression of artificial worlds inside a natural setting.
artificial looking:low-complexity level boundaries(walls, geometric shapes),
fake hydrological system(linear canals vs complex rivers),super-flat terrain
