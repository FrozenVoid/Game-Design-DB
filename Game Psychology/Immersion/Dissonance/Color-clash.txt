Color clash appears when an objects and background color schemes 
have a sharp contrast or create unnatural appearance that seems out of place:
usually the colors are either too saturated(appearing 'painted' in a muted setting)
or too bland(appearing as monochrome scheme in a varied color setting).
In rarer cases, specific colors like e.g. blue/purple will appear unnatural in a setting
that largely excludes them(usually applies to colors rare in nature), unless the color is
heavily muted(desaturated/dark).
