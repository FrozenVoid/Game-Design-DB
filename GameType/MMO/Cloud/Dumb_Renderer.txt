In "partial cloud" the user-visible
 graphics/media are rendered 
 locally but game logic exists
 on the server-only:
 the client is "dumb renderer"(
 analogue to "dumb terminal").
 
Advantages:
1.Superior performance.
2.Secure vs any attack
3.Content is centrally managed
vs user-downloadable "assets".
Disadvantages:
1.Requires a graphics processing
 capacity similar to normal games.
2.Sound/Music has to be either
generated by client or downloaded.
