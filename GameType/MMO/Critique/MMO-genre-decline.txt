MMOs today have lost the competition to more player-friendly
genres and game types, with good reasons:
1.MMOs surviving due heavy-handed monetization are a 
sign of maladaptive patterns: in particular "MMO whales",
dictating expirience from a minority of 'paying users' to
influence the genre in favor of whale-friendly, rather 
than average-user-friendly MMO.

2.Players don't see the value in social features of MMOs
with market competing with social networks and websites
having vastly leaner interaction model(not requiring a game
or having specific hardware). 

3.Player eager to compete, have alternative games which
don't require "grinding expirience" or "farming items",
with MOBA/Arena shooters/FPS evolving to surpass PvP expirience
of MMOs.

4.Casual players migrated to mobile/web games with multiplayer
features, with MMO bloated install sizes and high-hardware requirements
alienating casual/new players from "trying a game".

5.A general evolution in gaming where player-friendly features
evolved outside of MMOs 'time-gating' mechanics towards 'skill-based competition':
expirience grind and item-farming of MMOs no longer have the same appeal,
outside of nostalgia gamers.

6.Skill-based online games have attracted most player interested
in clever mechanics in MMOs(along with #3), as complex 3D engines
and network latency has not improved much.
