The evader archetype is player's intent to manipulate
luck during combat, by reducing hit-chance of an attack.
Summary:The Evader: This character has 100% chance to evade/dodge attack
or 0% chance to be hit.
a.A subtype - block: Has 100% blocking of all attacks.
equipment is geared to maximize block/evasion chnace.
a.B subtype - pure evasion/chance-to-be-hit: has 0% chance-to-be-hit due 
stacking items/skills giving modifiers to it.

Evader is range-based counterpart of Immortal
with less of staying power;
the Evader avoids direct combat and prefers safe attacks with
low chance of damage: usually moving/dancing around the target.
Typically such characters are defeated by 
area of effect spells/skills or non-dodgeable(guided) projectiles, 
for which Evader either prepares or flees.
A typical solution is hard cap on evasion chance
(e.g. 90% chance to evade) which forces Evaders to 
invest in alternatives(defense/absorb/resistance/damage conversion)
