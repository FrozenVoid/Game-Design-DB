The Tank archetype focuses on defensive abilities and equipment,
usually with allied players/pets/summons dealing actual damage,
while Tank serves as magnet for enemy attacks and healing spells from
allied players.
The player archetype of a Tank often has multiple equipment
sets to optimize for specific area conditions, which maximize
lifetime in absence of healing.
Tanks are core archetype of Tank/Healer/DPS trinity which
is optimized for boss farming: healer can be replaced
 by large inventory of healing potions/artifacts/etc and
  DPS can achieved with on-hit/aura/poison effects that
  wear off monsters over time.
