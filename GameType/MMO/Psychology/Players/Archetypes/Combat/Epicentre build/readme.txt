Epicentre build archetype refers to specific system
where player invests heavily in aura and static effects
centered on character(epicentre) that damage nearby enemies,
without dying himself.
The effects may manifest on-hit by launching counter-attacks
, reflecting gained damage or direct damaging aura.
The build is similar to Tank builds with intention
of close combat approach to initiate on-hit/in-range effects
of the build which enemy will try to evade.
The build is rarely used in game with long-range attacks
or utilizes teleportation combined with stun to keep 
targets inside the epicentre 
for maximum time if mechanics allow it.
