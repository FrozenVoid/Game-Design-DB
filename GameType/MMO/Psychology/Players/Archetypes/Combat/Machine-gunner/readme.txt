Machine-gunner is the archetype build for quick attacks;
the goal is to maximize speed at which damage is dealt,
aided by on-hit/on-cast modifiers being triggered by
each attack - Machine-gunner players intent is to 
create maximum projectiles per second, investing less
in one-hit damage, but raising damage-per-second output.
Magical Machine-gunners specialize in multi-projectile spells
with on-hit splitting/doubling effects most favored.
Physical Machine-gunners utilize skills which maximize
projectiles per attack, covering the screen with most
projectiles and area of effect collisions.
