One-hit Killer/Assassin archetype:
Invests in one key skill/attack to maximize damage
output allowing insane values which cause 
one-hit kills for everything. 
Such characters easily dominate PvP and single-target combat
if player has quick movement skills - the risk-taking
characteristic of this build leaves many weak spots(with
one-hit attack failing resulting in defeat).

Strategy of One-hit killer involves:
1.Investing heavily on all-in tactic with one hit damage(
rarely a few hits in rapid succession).
2.Surviving long enough to reach attack range.
3.Using item debuffs to overwhelm enemy resistance with on-hit items.
(usually part of one-hit attack).
4.Escaping the area, if enemies are nearby.

"The Assassin mode": uses in 
game stealth mechanics to avoid being detected 
most of the time, allow one-hit attacks and 
disappearance without much delay. 
The overpowered aspect is that characters/monsters
can't respond fast enough before assassin slips back
into "invisibility mode" or often just die.
