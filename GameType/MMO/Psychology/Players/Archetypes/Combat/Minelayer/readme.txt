Players who pick this archetype turn areas into
minefields with traps, wards, cursed items and AoE debuffs.
The tactics is usually described as 'scorched earth'
slowly advancing in the safety of current 'minefield'
towards the enemy range, who cannot approach back without
triggering the minefield.
The builds of this archetypes are often defensive in character
and maximize only a few traps/area debuffs that are the main
damage dealers. PvE minelayers use faster "surround tactic"
where monster is goaded into a ring of traps/debuffs.
