the Immortal archetype is the goal of players who want to create 
an invincible 'Tank' character. This player archetype
exploits the counter-damage mechanics of a game:

a.A subtype - Regeneration: Fast regen - oriented at regaining life 
very fast and having maximum life possible. 
Regen is often aided by damage-absorb 
and on-being-hit bonuses/perks/effects.

b.B subtype - static reduction: Damage reduction - stacks damage 
reduction items/skills/resistance to achieve 
near zero life loss, with massive life stats
and decent regen rate.

c.C subtype - hybrid/onhit: Damage reflection & regen - 
reflects near 100% damage and has enough 
regen to compensate loss of hit-points.
Some variations use on-being-hit modifiers 
to refill health and reduce damage.

Redirection-based tanking:
d.D subtype: damage redirected to some other stat, 
like life->mana with fast mana regen.

e.E subtype: redirects 100% of damage to external
pet/summon/entity which is healed/revived 
by aura/regen items automatically.

Impact;
Typically such characters once created ruin both 
PvP(cannot be killed) and PvE(infinite tanking of monsters)
balance, with corresponding  band-aid solution is use 
of percentage-of-life reducing skills/effects or unblockable damage.
Game mechanics which allow 'Immortals' to exist are fundamentally
unbalanced with such characters becoming dominant in combat.
