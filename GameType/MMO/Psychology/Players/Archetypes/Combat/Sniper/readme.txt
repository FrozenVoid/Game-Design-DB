A long-range combat archetype, player opt to maximize
range of attack and avoid close approaches:
usually using guided projectiles to fire outside
of visible range and improve accuracy.
The build neglects defensive attributes in favor
of quick escape from potential counter-attacks:
usually all is invested in range(high-damage sniping)
or attack-rate(low-med damage for clearing mobs from distance)
Attack-rate builds may morphs into "Machine-gunner" archetype
if level design excludes long range engagement.
