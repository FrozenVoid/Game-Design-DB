Dancer is a medium-range archetype of combat tactics;
The player maximizes the character speed and uses
rapid hit-and-run attack which whittle down the enemy,
without allowing counter-attacks to reach himself.
The archetype general tactic: 
use speed to bypass traps/defenses/summons
and performs few quick medium-range attacks and retreat
before enemy can respond.
The archetype requires quick reflexes and some defensive
attributes to survive(regen/healing/absorb) long-term.
Speed of movement has most utility with evasion of 
area-of-effect attacks and keeping distance from 
target: if the enemy invests in teleportation/speed/guided projectiles
most advantages of Dancer are nullified and quick
reflexes are only reason to continue attacking.
