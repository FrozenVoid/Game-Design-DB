The archetype utilizes AoE spells to turn combat
area into a 'acid carpet' region where enemies
have to repeatedly retreat, usually with long-lasting spells
that modify weather/ground/environment to 
deal constant damage for a period.
The archetypes maximizes mana/energy/cast speed attributes
and uses defensive spells/auras and teleportation for keeping
the character alive, while casting more and more spells at area.
