A ninja archtype is a category of stealth builds that
utilize game mechanics(where applicable) to reduce enemy
vision range and detection of itself. The ninja then
uses this 'invisibility'(actual or functional)
with movespeed for
quick hit-and-run attacks from medium to close range.
One-hit killers ninjas are possible, but the build will
sacrifice either visibility range or damage to One-hit killer
archetype that will win 1v1 if counter-attacking a ninja.
Ninja usually branch out to use variouds aids 
in their attacks, summons/traps/debuffs to ensure counter-attack
and possible detection will be slowed down, allowing time to escape.
