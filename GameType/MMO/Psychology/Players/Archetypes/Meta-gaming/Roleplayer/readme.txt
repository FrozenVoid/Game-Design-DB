The roleplayer utilizes the game as virtual chatroom with custom avatars,
his interest in game mechanics usually revolves around cosmetic items
and appearance changing effects(e.g. shapeshifting, mounts,pets).
While roleplayers will sometimes 'play seriously' they are mostly content at roleplay
fantasy that takes place in chat and general community of the game.
Roleplayers are focused in visual/audio quality of expirience,
with some interest in exploring the world, meeting NPCs and generally
enjoying in-game lore at slow pace. Roleplayer adopt a person that mimics their
character appearance and 'stay in character' instead of trying new classes or tactics.
Games with strong lore system, deep storyline and complex NPCs are roleplayer's delight
, games often accomodate their interests with separate 'roleplay' worlds:
this manifests in dedicated 'roleplay servers' for mmos to segragate them from
 competitive/economic players.
