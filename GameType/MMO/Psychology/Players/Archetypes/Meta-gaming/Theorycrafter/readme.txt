Theorycrafters are the archetype of MMO scientists.
They usually play as some other archetype, while test hypothesises or exotic
builds to confirm their validity in some metric.
Theorycrafters usually 'build' the idea of new setup outside the game
and only use the game to confirm the idea.
Theorycrafters are first archetype to deeply study(or reverse engineer) game mechanics
and analyze the gameplay process at length, then inform the community with their
discoveries and theories - building guides, collecting data and refininf conclusions.
Game with complex mechanics, intricate skill/item interactions and balanced classes
easily attract theorycrafters who find holes in the system, creating overpowered
/exotic/whimsy builds that game designers didn't expect.
Theorycrafter can be subtyped into;
A.Build Optimizers; discover builds which revolve on mazimizing some key attribute.
This is core theorycraft speciality which utilize below game knowledge.
A theorycrafted build will eventually be refined and used as cookie-cutter build
recipes by the community, as new meta-game facts and tactics are discovered with time:
Item attributes, skills and stat combinations that are optimal in some way.
B.Tacticians; discover optimal tactics vs monsters/npcs/player classes.
C.Speedrun theorists; discover optimal/fastest/easiest pathing.
D.Economists; research game economy and especially its flaws.
E.Exotic Builders; theorycraft underutilized/rare setups and experimenting.
F.Mechanics; research game mechanics interactions.
H.Craft theorists; research item crafting aspects.
