Arbitrator is a high-end trader that utilizes market forces to his advantage;
Their operating motive is profit on trade, using their knowledge of item/resource
values and economic laws(supply/demand) applied in a virtual economy.
tactics(incomplete, usually mimics real-world market tactics):
A.Buy low, Sell high: arbitrators search for deals to 'arbitrate the price' by 
selling under-priced resources/items at their true market price.
B.price hike; by maintaining close control over limited supply in some niche,
arbitrators may hike prices if supply is low utilizing monopoly-like power.
C.Hoard and dump ;Arbitrator will sell off the inventory of some resource if the market
is overvaluing the resource, often due arbitrator(s) hoarding the resource.
D.Fake interest/fake bet; by maintaining two accounts the arbitrator can introduce
fake interest in specific commodity/item, to hike its price. 
usually banned by game TOS and game rules:
This tactic is common with auctions(where price hike is automated) and
requires skills to detect from outside, as arbitrators may use
multiple accounts to simulate bets, large interest from
multiple(fake) players without actual auction interest: the bets
or buys from the 'source account' to 'target account' usually are cancelled at
last moment, leaving the second-place better to 'win' the auction.
