Thief archetype is economy-focused player who steals or scams 
items/resources from others. Games which allow stealing,full loot or weak security
in trade, give space this archetype exploits to flourish.
The player which operates this archetype is operating without
in-game rules or etiquette, bypassing system constraints and exploiting mechanics.

Sub-Types of thief archetype(observed specializations):
A.Trade scammer; this type uses trade interface to steal items or resource 
by misrepresentation of their actual value; usually substituting an inferior 
similar-looking item for expensive item/resource.
B.Loot Thief;this player bypasses team etiquette and group dynamics to grab loot
without consensus or sharing, usually operating in ad-hoc battle groups where
cooperation is not enforced and party cohesion is low.
Spells/skills which can manipulate/grab items are often favorite of such thieves due
distance advantage in looting.
C.Trick thief; the thief convinces its target to part with items for some
perceived benefit(enhancement/craft/etc) for a moment and disappears with them.
c2.Fake service; this type operates in newbie areas to advertise some service 
which usually involves giving the thief items/resources and thief disappearing.
D.Game mechanic-based theft: this archetype uses theft mechanics to their
fullest extent to maximize effect. With modern games 'outright theft' is
usually banned but looting dead characters is often allowed if thief is an ally.

Thieves are often the target of game security, with various strategies
from loot-binding to trade limits, reducing incentives to scam/theft 
and active moderation of economic transactions to deter theft plots by
reversing/nullifying transactions that are reported(often automated).
