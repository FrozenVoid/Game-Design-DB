A hoarder is a subtype of a Collector that doesn't discriminate item quality,
literally hoarding garbage items/junk resources in vague hope they'll be useful someday.
Hoarding is psychologically linked to grind gameplay and maximization of
inventory space as hoarder is only concerned with quantity vs quality of items.
Game which attract hoarders usually allow unlimited or huge
inventory space, multiple inventories and storage multipliers.
When hoarder gets tired of low-level junk and starts to liquidate 'the hoard' 
he might turn into more discriminating Collector(hoarding only quality items)..
