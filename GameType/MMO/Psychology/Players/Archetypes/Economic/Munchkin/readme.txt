Munchkins are 'build setup' optimizers that have low combat
skills but are eager to theorycraft clever setups to ensure
their performance will be 'best in theory' due perfect equipment/skill/item set.
Munchkins will utilize exploits/glitches/min-maxing and unfair tactics
to get what they want(either items or status) in easiest/fastest way
possible without any appreciation for the game process or atmosphere(
which munchkins often term 'fluff').
Munchking will speedrun/rush/skip all possible obstactles
to their final 'endgame' which they intend to play at
easiest level of difficulty due their setup.
While munchkins are not cheaters, they will tend to abuse
game mechanics and simplify game processes to minimize effort spent:
this naturally leads to botting, automation scripts and hacking
where munchkin is faced with 'technically superior' solutions to
simply playing the game(munchkins rarely enjoy 'just' gaming,
instead either grinding or following a cookie-cutter theorycrafted script
to ensure success in task).
As its type indicates Munchkins are economy-centric build
focused on obtaining/selling items necessary for the munchkin setup;
munchkins avoid risky combat and prefer safe grind-type gameplay.
