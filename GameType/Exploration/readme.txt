Exploration games are similar in principle
to interactive movies or adventure games,
with a relaxed, calm atmosphere concentrated 
on lore and puzzle/mystery solutions that 
lack quick twitch reflexes and stat-based progression.

Pure exploration games are rare, since
gamers prefer more active genres where
elements of RPG/Adventure are dominant:
however newer games seem to expand in this
direction as showcase of game engine 
features and complexity.
