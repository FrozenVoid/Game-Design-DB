Stats can be stored as floating point double (64-bit),
instead of tracking 'integer points' with a limited range.
Calculations of percentages and modifiers are much easier too,
as well as display rounded to xx.yy% or xx.yyy as required.
Using integers makes sense only for tracking sequenced quantities
such as levels of something(x+1).
