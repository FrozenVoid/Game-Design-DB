An increase by 10-15%(x1.1-x1.15) is a sweet spot
for level gaps, allowing fast early leveling
but gradually increasing the level gap
(doubling each 7 levels for x1.1 or each 5 levels for x1.15).
vs current systems:
current level progression system provide much less
levels per exp curve, leaving player dissatisfied with progression
speed.
