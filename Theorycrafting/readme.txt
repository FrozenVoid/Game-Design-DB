Theorycrafting is an umbrella term for studying game strategies 
at depth. The scope of theorycrafting includes reverse-engineering,
but most research doesn't include internal game state:
theorycrafting can be considered as game-specific research that focuses
on solving problems without playing/experimenting(that is only used to confirm/deny
 hypothesis/build/rule in the game).
Theorycrafting can be divided into following broad categories;
1.Tactical: solving parts of game optimally, optimization of single
 situation or specific problem without global strategy.

2.Strategic: devising plans and schemes to confirm/refute some problem/theory:
e.g. confirming that a specific build works.

3.Research: uncovering some aspect of the game to understand the mechanics/rules
governing it. This may involve software to study game control flow, variables,
and disassembly of game parts to confirm hypotheses/ideas.

4.Lore study: Lore theorycrafting is answering questions/problems coming from
incomplete understanding of game lore, design origins and inspirations.
e.g. what is the origin of enemy X? Why is the color of Y is Z?
What makes level M special? Why does protagonist appear Q in level N?
