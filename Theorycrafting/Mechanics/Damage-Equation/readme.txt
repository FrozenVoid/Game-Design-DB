Damage equation is a core part of combat mechanics that
defines how player interacts with environment:
Parts:
1.Incoming damage modifiers: bonuses, chances, targeting radius/distance
2.Defensive modifiers: how much damage is absorbed, resisted or negated.
3.Post-damage triggers: reflection, healing, damage to stat mechanics.
4.Status updates:deaths/injury mechanics.
