A premium currency in a game is usually acquired by paying the game company externally
(cash shop, subscription reward, bonus for purchases of specific content/item)
with in-game means to gather such currency(or premium resource) being scarce to non-existent.
Many micro-transaction based games rely on premium currency system to avoid
player realizing the true nature of micro-transactions:
1.The sunk cost fallacy dictates that once purchased the premium currency must be spent:
Users are often prevented from hoarding currency by means of expiring tokens
(limited chance/item/bonus that has to be used in N days) and
inflation of paid content prices, decided on whims of game managers.

2.Premium currency is usually non-refundable and exists only in statistic account.
The purchases of such currency is one-way cash flow into company profits:
the gamers are not holding anything externally valuable that would exist without the
virtual world managed by the company.

3.Micro-transactions in premium currency hide their cost in real-world currency.
Psychologically, the virtual currency is not viewed as valuable due it being limited and
confined to a game(artificially set value of currency unit), thus stimulating its use vs real-money purchases
(e.g. 5$ item vs 500 Crystals item).

4.THe real cost of specific content is often hidden with layers of 
indirect purchases of resources/craft material and other expenses that are required
to get high-level items: the chain of cash->premium currency-> resource->material-> item
is not readily apparent and hidden by in-game economy providing 'alternatives' to
paid resources or ability to buy them from other players(who paid for them in 
premium currency) with in-game currency/resource.
