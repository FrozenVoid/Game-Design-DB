A tooltip appears when player's cursor hovers over an element.
Tooltip-type popups provide critical information from item stats to
skill descriptions, or giving quick help messages when interface elements/buttons are hovered on.
More often good design of tooltip system is central to the UI of the game itself, being the most important source of information to player.
Good design:
1.Fonts; information has to be available in legible,bold font.
2.Info density; information has to be laconic, useful and precise.
Examples of useless tooltip information: random names, lore, verbose descriptions,etc any text/icon/picture without relevance - usually
 added for 'atmospheric/authenthic feeling' that is novel only once, but wastes UI space forever.
3.Color; colors have to be distinct from interface background and tooltip
 background(if not transparent), avoiding muted/dark colors.
4.Info order; Information should be ordered by priority(Item/Skill/Trait stats).
5.Speed;in some case crucial in middle of combat(monster stats Tooltips),
with tooltip appearing instantly being a requirement for fast-paced games.
