Synopsis:
Players running out of inventory space, with non-stackable consumables, junk items and vendor trash.
Players begin to notice game flaws in item organization and focus on inventory management instead of gameplay itself(immersion breaking mode switching). Limited inventory space leads to player's
creating arbitrary values for items based on their space requirement,
rather than their attributes.
The 'mode-switching' interruption in managing every new item,
swapping/dropping items and backtracking to reorganize items collection
is a major structural flaw as constraints of storage per-characters
can be easily increase far above visual limits of one-page inventory
with minimal space cost.
