A pie chart indicator can be used to 
showcase critical states(hp/mana/rage):
multiple pie chart of different colors can
be embedded in each other(each segment representing 0-100% state) :
example:
inner orange core: pie chart of rage meter.
outer blue pie chart segment: mana
second red circle segment : hitpoints.
(segments look like doughnut pie chart enveloping the core)
