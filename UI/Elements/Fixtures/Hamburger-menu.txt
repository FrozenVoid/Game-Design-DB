Hamburger menu is a poorly designed permanent fixture
that opens a popup menu by pressing a button;
the button usually contain 3 dots or lines, which doesn't
indicate the user anything without familiarity with the concept.
Hamburger menu evolved from 'compact-layout' designs to reduce
space menu selectors takes, hover the savings are irrelevant when
the only menu is the hamburger menu.

how to fix: Use text labels and actual menu bars.
A single 'Menu' word is x1000 more intuitive and reachable.
Avoid abstract icons and anything hinging on user's intepretation of graphical symbols(e.g. quickbars/action icons) as these require memorization and familiarity.
Text is always more accesible, less ambigious and less confusing than a graphical icon.
