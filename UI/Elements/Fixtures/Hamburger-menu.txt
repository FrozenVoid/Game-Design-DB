Hamburger menu is a poorly designed permanent fixture
that opens a popup menu by pressing a button;
the button usually contain 3 dots or lines, which doesn't
indicate the user anything without familiarity with the concept.
Hamburger menu evolved from 'compact-layout' designs to reduce
space menu selectors takes, hover the savings are irrelevant when
the only menu is the hamburger menu.
