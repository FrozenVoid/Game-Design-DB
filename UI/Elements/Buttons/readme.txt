Key functionality should be represented unambiguosly and without alternatives - a common approach is to use buttons.
 A user should immediately know and feel that "big button" is the right one to use, without wasting time to doubt(is it the right button) or search for it(is it behind a menu,dialog,etc?): having too many buttons(ambiguity) or
 buttons that are easy to misclick(small size) is bad for UI.

Key buttons are designed for actions;
1.Which are not immediate; use hotkeys/popup menus/action bars.
Buttons are intermediate form of interactive functionality that requires 
speed and lacks repetition(in case of repetition, button should have a hotkey).
2.Perform important function(e.g. confirming trade);unimportant actions can be
handled by menu choices/modal dialogs.
3.Specific to current context; all options are gathered from current UI content and button simply confirms action in the dialog.
4.Doesn't require additional confirmation:
Actions which are global state functions(e.g. logoff/overwrite/delete),
need some confirmation dialog to avoid misclicks and user errors.

A user should not perform extra actions to ensure that key functionality works(available by default, key action ensures its requirements are met )
Example: Start/Stop button on video. Located at edge of screen, using the Triangle/Two-Blocks symbols that are universal for the format.


Button margins: Key buttons should have a safety margin to
reduce misclicks.
