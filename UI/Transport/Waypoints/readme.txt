A waypoint is a level object that opens Transport UI(teleport lists, magic maps,portal network) to allow player to instantly teleport to another location. 
Advantages:
Teleport lists(waypoints) are very robust, having no inventory/skill/stat requirement.
Very fast to operate, don't require magic/skill cast or special setup(portal opening).
Spawn location on destination is usually set to be neutral.
Exploring the map gives access to all waypoints by activation/presence.
(Waypoints usually limit access to them until activated.)
Scales to multiple players using them simultaneusly.
Intuitive and easy to operate, no special skills.
