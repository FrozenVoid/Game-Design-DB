A player-origin waypoint is like a permanent invisible portal
into a location. Players starts with an empty list of waypoints
(character-specific) that is filled by adding a location to the list
with some skill/item/interface activation, which also grants
access to previous waypoints(allowing to erase them or use them). Player waypoints can take level name or be named by 
player for convinience.
