Conway's Game of Life is class of cellular automata
that operates under mechanical progression rules  
that simulate evolution of a closed system,
where cells in a (typically) rectangular grid are created, stay
and disappear according to specific 'ruleset'
which defines each singular cell fate as result
of interaction with nearby cells(usually a 3x3 block),
where amount of neighbour cells alive(or of specific color)
set next generation status(or color) of each cell in the ruleset.

The specific variant employed in production of patterns
in this database is 'Generations' algorithm which
allows up to 256 colors(states):
