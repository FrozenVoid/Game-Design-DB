color coded enemies
The idea is to assign attributes to enemies based on color
where a base category e.g. a 'turtle' is given specific attribute
examples;
red turtle - faster movespeed
green turtle - jumps higher
yellow turtle - runs away from player's avatar
blue turtle - spits acid
white turtle - regenerates fast
black turtle - increased base hp/hits
purple turtle - teleports
