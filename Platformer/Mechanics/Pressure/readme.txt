Platformer levels can have a parameter defining movement in
denser substance (e.g. underwater density) which counteracts Gravity;
In case pressure is enough to counteract gravity, characters/enemies
float without gravity effects, however denser objects fall faster.
Pressure defines "Air pressure" equivalent density that objects
of that density float in place, high density sink/fall, and lower 
density rise to the top.
