Platformer levels have adjustable 'Gravity' parameters which
define the speed of falling object, jump height and descent speed of character.
Usually both enemy and player character abide by same gravity rules:
however some bonuses might give character ability to reduce/increase gravity
either locally(to character avatar).
Some bonuses/trigger could change gravity level parameter for a period,
which would alter physics of a level(e.g. physics puzzles).
