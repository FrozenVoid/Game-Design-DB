simple variations on rules:


live_go:
Same as normal Go, but stones may move 1 cell diagonally or orthogonally(instead of drop move). 

spawn_go:
After first 5 stones of a player are on board, next stones can only be placed near existing friendly stones(adjacent diagonally/orthogonally). 

jump_go:
In addition to go rules: a stone may jump over an adjacent enemy stone to capture it(as in checkers but restricted to one stone vertically/horizontally). 

conversion_go:
Stones are not removed but are converted to capturing player color.
