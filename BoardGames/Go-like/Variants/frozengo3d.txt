This is a hypothethical 3d variant:
Board Size:Cube cells 8x8x8
The sides of The Cube are connected with their opposites:
e.g.The right side is connected to the left side forming 
a closed tunnel,where liberties are shared through 
the edge side of the cube cell.


Liberties:
only external to structure are valid(shell liberties), 
internal empty cubes not counted.
The liberty must be orthogonally connected(i.e.form a tube)
 with a cell in the player structure(diagonal liberties are not valid).
Picture 6 liberties of single cube:

Score:By Number of stones on the board(higher number wins)
+0.5 stone for white(as compensation for first move)
+handicap (decided by rating).
Handicap stones are not placed on board.

Capture: Surrounded(zero liberties) stones change color 
to capturer side. Surround requires covering structure 
with shell(edge cubes can be deprived of liberties by
 surrounding the mirror side with liberties on the edge)

Standard Move:
drop 1 stone in any cell that allows at least 1 liberty
(chain with 1 liberty(eye) is alive).
Teleport - same as above, but a stone is removed
(as selected by player:stone selected -> cube cell destination)
Special Moves:
-------------------
Diagonal Conversion: if an unconnected(does not form a tube)
 enemy stone exists diagonally adjacent to your stone
 you can capture it to your color.In 3D diagonals are 
all not orthogonally/vertically/horizontally connected tubes
(i.e. not up/down left/right/forward/backward direction)

SideSwap - swap with nearby enemy stones:
if stones touch by sides of cubes(3D 2cube tube ),
enemy stone[E][Y] it swaps to [Y][E]

Push -
Move stone(must be connected to friendly stone(s) 
at the moment of move) forward 1sq to any orthogonal direction
(in 3d tube-connected)) occupied by enemy stone, 
pushing the enemy and following stones by the line 
towards the side of the cube(if no gaps exists, 
otherwise pushes them into gap).(if stones move over the edge
 they reappear at opposite side:the cube is closed).




===============
Cube Rotation(is rotated over 1 axis):
Cube NxNxN(N:2-7) cells can be rotated 90deg, 
180deg and 270deg on a chosen axis of rotation,
if your units are the majority in the cube.
