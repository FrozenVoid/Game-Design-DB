A swap move occurs when a player swaps content of two occupied cells
which have common points in a 3x3 cube with center on the occupied cell.
Example:
Opponent occupied cell at 7,7 is touching your cell at 6,6 by diagonal.
A swap move exchanges stones from both cells(7,7 is now yours and 6,6 is opponents).
