A player who controls the majority of occupied cells in a NxNxN cube
may "translate" its contents cells vectors arranging cells symmetry along mirrored directions.
A mirroring move is similar(a more general form) to a rotation of a cube,
but instead of 'rotating', exchanges cells along the mirrored axis/grids.
The following possinle mirroring moves in NxNxN (X height,Y width,Z depth locations) exist(Mirror(X,Y,Z) to (Z,Y,Z) in a cube NxNxN).
1.Content of cell at X,Y,Z will appear translated to Z,Y,X location in the cube.
2.Content of cell at X,Y,Z will appear translated to Z,X,Y location in the cube.
3.Content of cell at X,Y,Z will appear translated to X,Z,Y location in the cube.
4.Content of cell at X,Y,Z will appear translated to X,Y,Z location in the cube.
5.Content of cell at X,Y,Z will appear translated to Y,X,Z location in the cube.
6.Content of cell at X,Y,Z will appear translated to Y,Z,X location in the cube.
