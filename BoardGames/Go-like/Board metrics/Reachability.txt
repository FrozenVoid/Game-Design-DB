Each empty intersection minimal manhattan distance to your side 
stones is summed and divided by number of
empty intersection(that are reachable without 
moving through enemy stones).
If path(manhattan distance) can't reach your stone
from intersection, that square is ignored from calculations.
Formula=(S/N):
S= Sum of manhattan distances to 
N=Number of reachable empty intersections.
A large ratio(high average distance to own stones) indicates
low reachability, and lack of power projection:
low ratio indicates good reachability and plenty of
power over the board.
