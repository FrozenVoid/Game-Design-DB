when two builds clash it might be neccessary to
explain the relative power of cards:
1.if two cards conflict with similar scope
the more specific scope of influence wins;
e.g. luck(chance-based events) wins vs influence(all events)

2.protective power of cards is resolved to greatest scope of
protection vs damage,
invulnerability (physical body) loses vs death(non-specific death).

3.information based powers are resolved
as more powerful/fastest with most specific scope(unless
the scope is more complete version of another);
so data card(instant data overlay) wins vs knowledge(generic focus on power)
but data card(instant data overlay) loses vs prediction(future view) as
prediction can get data from the future, while data is current)
