Type: match in a row.
Board: 25x25 cells, initially set with random numbers 1 to 9
Players:2
Turns: each turn has 60 seconds to setup all lines.
before first turn all initial sequences are scored,
removed and added to second players score  
until the board contains no 3+ sequences - as a balancing mechanism.

At the end of turn, all sequences of 3+ numbers in row/column 
are removed and their score added to player score, 
then empty cells are filled with other random numbers.

Score:3+ same numbers in row or column such as 3,3,3 score as multiplication of their values=3*3*3=27 points
Win condition: 100K score or when no valid sequences found for 2 turns(then biggest score wins).

Moves: 1.swap any cell with adjacente orthogonal cell to make 3in a row number sequence.
2. If there isn't a match(3+ in a row/column), the move is cancelled. 
3.each turn can have as many valid moves as player can handle.




example:  
_2_3_
_3_2_2 
_x_3_
by swaping top 2 with middle 3, the 2-2-2 chain is destroyed for score(2*2*2=8).
Alternatively left 3 is swapped with center 2 to score 3*3*3=27 points(better)

Special case: instead of 1*1*1=1, the 1's are added instead of multiplied.
so 3 1's in a row gives 3 score, not 1(1*1*1)
