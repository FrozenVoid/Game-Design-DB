    --changes from v12--

    New Terrain levels mechanic:units can raise/lower terrain on which they stand: can only move to lower/equal elevation.(level is -63 +63)
    Movement cannot climb in terrain level:
    (if unit path is above a lowered square(one lowered square only) the unit can bypass it and any unit inside it).


    New Earthquake ability: resets terrain levels by exploding any of your non-pawn unit(except king).

    New Flood ability:flood all adjacent empty negative level ground squares(all units stepping into them ae paralyzed).


    New Box mechanic:unit can be Boxed(immune to damage,cannot move) and Box can be pushed/teleswapped/pulled/opened.

    New Egg Fusion ability: fused eggs(any allied egg can be fused to another on the board) grow as N eggs would grow in single turn(similar to quickening:60 turns become 20 with 3x egg) and produce 1 dragon.


    New Syzygy ability:a non-pawn unit which moves into a mirrorportal square of enemy unit of same kind:locks both units in-place(until rotated/teleswapped/swapshotted).

    New Shift mechanic:if you control(all units in line are yours) a line you can shift it N spaces down/up left/right.(cannot contain any enemy units in tombs or enemy shadows)

    New Fusion Absorb mechanic:fused unit can absorb all nearby 3x3 paralyzed enemies.

    New Bind mechanic:bind nearby unit to unit group/other unit, move/teleport moves center+bound units.(works as multi-unit transport).

    New Loop mechanic:unit can enter Loops of moves.

    Bishops and Knights are back.

    Conversion is restricted to diagonal move-type,penalty increased to N/2.

    Mind Control is restricted to orthogonal move-type.

    ====================================================
    Key mechanics
    ===============
    Box/Unbox: Special move by changing any unit into a Box(a safe transport unit containing the player unit).
    Unbox(only by owning player) removes unit from Box mode at cost of paralysis of N/3(where N is amount of squares travelled in Box form). Boxes cannot move, but can be pushed/teleswapped/pulled/moved by external means(including moves by enemy).
    Box can be thought of as safe container that 
   cannot be captured, and can be used to block paths
   or landing squares, as well as moving units into
   specific position for tactical advantage.
   
    Syzygy: A non-pawn unitA moving into mirror portal(board square where board is mirrored 
    x,y->Len-y,Len-x) square of enemy unitB of same kind(A and B of same type) locks both units in place as if they are both paralyzed. Units A/B cannot be selected/used while in this state.
    Syzygy is removed when one of units is rotated/teleswapped/swapshotted/pulled/pushed or moved by external means. 
    Units that are Guarded or in start position are not affected. 
    Rotate calculations are performed on unitA/B as if they were paralyzed units.
    example on 8x8 board: 
    A Rook moving into b3, paralyzes Rook on g6(8-3,8-b). 

    Paralysis mode(ability/effect of actions):
    Freezes unit in its place as if it has become 
    a statue of unit.
    Units can't move/capture/use
    abilities while paralyzed for N moves
    (i.e. if they could moves in players turn,
    they wait until N player turns pass).

    Paralysis Transfer:Any unitA(non-paralyzed(able-to-be paralyzed),not threatened by enemy units) protecting unitB(paralyzed) can take 4 paralysis moves from UnitB as special move.(reduce paralysis penalty by X, by making itself paralyzed for X moves).After being paralyzed unitA(From UnitB) no longer protects and unable to do another paralysis transfer. If UnitB has less than 4 paralysis(moves), UnitA still gets +4 paralysis penalty.
    -------
    Kind Immunity - a non-pawn piece cannot
    engage a piece of its own kind
    (e.g. knight can do nothing to knights)
    with any capture/abilitymove.
    Example:
   a knight at b3 cannot capture a knight at d4.
    Exceptions:pawns,kings(can aid checkmate) can affect each other(but not capture if non-pawn unit).

    ----
    Shift - Special move: move a line orthogonally on board where only your units exist, wrapping over the edge of board. Squares don't change color, only units are shifted
    as 'line unit movement'.
    If any enemy units exist on the Shift line, Shift cannot be performed. Minimum of 2 units per line.
  example: only you have units on 4th line(one bishop and 1 pawn) and g line(1 knight and 2 pawn), so you can shift these units along the 4th or g line, optionally wrapping over the horizontal/vertical sides.
  

    -------
    Entanglement - Capturing Units of same kind
    (excluding pawns)
    which share a line or diagonal,captures them all.
    Capture multimove award is counted
    as multiple sequential captures,
    CRR reduces as if the capture was one.
    Example:
   A bishop at c5 capturing a rook at e7,
   also captures rook at h7(connected by 7th line),
   a rook at g5(connected by h7-g5 diagonal)
   and a rook at e2(connected by e-line).
    ----------------------------
    Bind - allied units can be bound to unit group that touches them diagonally or orthogonally.
    Moving one of the bound units moves all of units connected with Bind - if the destination squares are vacant:otherwise move is illegal(unlike Fusion it moves
   Occupied squares A-> Empty Squares B).
  Example: a knight at b3 touches a bishop at c4,
  allowing a bind move, to create a b3-c4 group;
  at next player turn the group can be move
  by either knight or bishop,if the destination squares
  e.g. f7,g8 are vacant(bishop move to g8 drags knight to f7) or c5,d6(knight from b3 to c5 drags bishop to d6). 

    Unbind:to unbind simply move a unit away from group/bind units.
    Bind/Unbind count as special move and ends multimove.

    -----------------------------
    Fusion/De-Fusion -
    Two+ friendly units(except King and pawns)
    (A and B) can fuse into unit AB which has the
    capabilities of both(can use AB as either unitA
    or UnitB(for move/capture/ability):
    Enemy can select which of the two units 
    in the AB fused-unit he wants to affect/capture
    and it affects the entire fused AB unit
    (e.g. to bypass immunity or secondary effect,
    capturing AB by capturing B instead of capturing A).
    Fuse: move A into square occupied by B.
    The multi-Move awards are reset on de-fuse
    (from all units in fused unit).

    De-fuse: Select(A or B) from AB square
    and move it away(the other units remains at AB square).
    Limit of Units in fused unit:
    unlimited(e.g. A&B&C&D combine into ABCD unit)
  

    --------
    Morph - Any unit which is not threatened by enemy units(not in capture area for single move), can transform into another unit (with exception of Kings/pawns which cannot use Morph or be transformed into).
    Paralyzed,fused,shadow mode,trapped units cannot morph(only normal state units).
    Morph resets all unit stats to default(as if new unit was created in its place).
     Max units of same type is 8 per player(e.g. 8 queens);
 
    -----------------------
    Empower - piece which is protected by
    one piece(except Kings/Pawns)) gains its native movement
    and capture ability(Kings/pawns cannot
    be empowered or give empowerment).
    e.g. a knight protected by a rook
    can move and capture like a rook for one move.
    Only applies if the empowering unit is not threatened by enemy, isn't in paralysis/spell effect.
    ------------------------
    Guards - if a unit is protected by
    two or more (non-pawn) pieces it is
    not empowered but cannot be captured
    (can capture normally when guarded).
    Kings cannot be guarded.
   e.g. a pawn protected by Knight and Bishop
   cannot be captured at its square.
    only applies if the guarding units are not threatened by enemy and not in paralysis.
    ----------------------------
    SwapShotAny - units(except king) can also swap
    places with units(except king) which they can capture
    (threat of capture,even if unit is friendly).
    e.g. Knight which can capture a pawn can
    swap places with it
    (works within single move only,
    doublemove/multimove range is ignored).
    SwapShot doesn't work on guarded enemy units.
    --------------------------
    Mirror Portal:
    each square on board has a mirror square(mirroring:half-board rotated into another half) a non-pawn piece can teleport at will as special move.
    Teleport(x,y) to Square(16-y,16-x)
    Escape to a square which is a mirror location 
    (as if the white side board rotated 180deg and
    inserted in the black side) if the mirror
    square is empty or tomb.
   e.g. a b3 square on 8x8 board is mirror 
   of g6(8-3)(8-b).
    Mirror portal carries a Paralysis penalty
    of N/2 turns, where N is distance between mirror squares.
   
    ===================
    Conversion:Convert unit to your side without moving.
    Conversion is valid only to squares where unit can move(units which capture differently from moving cannot convert) and entire path cannot be threatened by
    enemy units 1move capture range(including the converted
    unit itself and the convertor origin square).
    Conversion is avalable only for ranged unit diagonal moves(such as Bishop/Queen/Dragon) and works at range of movement(not multi-move).
    If a piece can capture another non-guarded/non-protected enemy piece,
    and if the capturing unit is not in double/multi move:
    The enemy unit can be converted insted of capturemove.
    Conversion:After conversion capturer is
    in paralysis for N/2 moves(where N is distance to converted unit,converted piece isn't affected).
    Conversion example:
A bishop at h7 instead of capturing a knight at d3 converts
it at cost of 5/2=2 turn paralysis at h7.
Conversion is always preferable to capturing but
not always available: the virtual move path must be safe
at all squares.

    -------------------------
    Spawn - Any unit(except kings) can spawn
    a copy of itself(new unit of same type) in an empty nearby (3x3) square.
    Both the original unit and the spawn square need not to be threatened by enemy units(even if unit is immortal).
    After spawn both units(the original and copy are paralyzed(bypasses paralysis immunity)) for 40 moves for non-pawn units and 15 for pawns.
    Restrictions: 4 units of same type max can exist, if 4 units
    already exist of same type - player cannot spawn more.
 Example: knight at b3 spawns a Knight a b2,
 both knight enter 40 turn ubreakable paralysis(bypasses any immunity/counter).

    -==Units and their moves==
    ==========PAWN==========
    Pawn: move 1-2sq in any direction
    2sq movement is a leap in any orthogonal direction.
    Capture 1sq diagonally in any direction
    or as in 2sq leap the square which is leaped.
    Example move:
    d4 to c4,b4,e4,f4,d2,d3,d5,d6,c3,e3,c5,e5
    Example capture leaps- destination(captured);
    d4 to b4(c4),f4(e4),d6(d5),d2(d3).
    Example capture diag:
    d4 to c3,e3,c5,e5

    Pawn special Moves:

    Piece Promotion: capturing a non-pawn
    piece promotes the pawn into the
    same kind of piece.
    (capture a knight to get a knight)
    Example; pawn capturing a knight at d4,turns 
    into a knight at d4(new unit of same type).
    Max:8 units of same type(i.e. no promotion if 8 units
    of same type already exists)

    Last File promotion:
    pawns at last file, promote to any pieces
    except king and pawn(as in chess).
     Max:8 units of same type(i.e. restricted to pieces with 7 or less
     units on board)

    Pincer:unit whose orthogonal sides are
    occupied with pawns are paralyzed until
    pawns leave or die.
    example: a knight at d4 is paralysed
    by enemy pawns at c4 and e4.



    =========BISHOP============
    Bishop:Moves:as chess bishop(diagonals)
    or 1sq orthogonally. Moves::
    Example: a bishop at d4 can move diagonally
    or to c4,e4,d5,d3.
    Capture:Diagonals only.
    Ability:Conversion(Diagonal)





   
  

    ==NIGHTRIDER===
    Moves as knight diagonally(repeated knight moves
    along diagonals:cannor change direction in single move)
    , captures as moves. 
    Range is never reduced due capture
    (can move up to edge of board).
   Special move:
   Knight leap - capture a unit leaped over(limited 1 per turn).
    

    ====CROSSBOWMAN=====
    Cannot capture:
    Ability: Poison Arrow x2(paralysis)
    Projectile power:
    paralysis for floor(16/range)+3 moves.

    Movement;
    orthogonally 1-5 squares, diagonally 1sq.
    
    Shoots 2 arrow in one diagonal direction(2 parallel green arrows)
  Poison Arrow x2 paralysis shots:   
    Example: a crowbowman at a1 shoots
    from a2-g8 and b1-h7 diagonals hiting the first
     units in the diagonals paths. 


    
    

    ===ASSASSIN======
    Bonus stat:De-shadowing paralysis penalty is divided by 3.
    Range of Move/capture is 1chess knight move or 3 squares orthogonally.
    e.g. a d4 assassin can move/capture to d1,d7,a4,g4
    or as chess knight move to c6,b5,b3,c2,e2,f3,f5,e6.

    Ability: Assassin's Run
    After capture, can perform another capture, until limit of 3 per move.
    After last(2nd/3rd) capture transforms into shadow form(only if minimum 2 captures made) and move ends.
    

    Ability:WallClimb/WallJump
    Assassins can enter/exit wall squares if they stand orthogonally adjacent to them as special move.The exit move must land on empty non-threatened square.
    Movement on the wall is restricted to the wall squares, until WallJump is performed and unit leaves wall.
    WallJump is moving orthogonally 1sq away from the wallsquare to empty adjacent square.

    Ability:Wall Tunnel construct.
    If the Assassin stays in a square adjacent to a wall for 2 moves, and there is empty,non-threatened square on the other side, he can create a Tunnel, which makes the wall passable through the tunnel square
    for the player's side.Player piece on Tunnel entrance moving forward, exits from the other side of wall
    Tunnel exists as long as the wall.
    Example; assasing at d4 before wall at d5
    makes tunnel from d4-d6, allowing orthogonal
    movement units from tunnel owner's side to move through.
    

    Special:Bomb(3x3)
    Leave a bomb on the Square of presence(as part of new move), if the 3x3 squares around are empty of units.The bomb explodes 3x3, when the 3x3 square is entered by enemy units, destroying any units/wall/tombs. Bombs are visible to both players.
    Only one bomb per assassin at same time can exist.
    Example:
    bomb left at d4 explodes(3x3sq) as enemy bishop
    enters    d5 square.


    Ability: Retain Empowered Move
    Can move, but not capture as the last unit that empowered the Assassin.(retain empower moves for non-capture moves). Restricted to last unit.

    Special Move :Slip square created at any square in movement range(unit landing on it moves forward N/3 sq in direction of move(where N is initial move distance(start to Slip square)). Only one Slip Square per assassin can exist,
    and requires the square to be non-threatened by enemy
    moves(not in 1move range).
        
    e.g. a Slip square at d4 forces a bishop
    arriving from b2-d4 to make 3/1 =1extra sq move
    landing on e5 instead.Slip squares work for both
    sides units. Movement cannot continue if the path is
    occupied by other units/walls as its continuation
    of normal movement in same direction(moving into a trap is allowed).
    units not moving orthogonally/diagonally are immune
    to Slip squares entirely.
    
    =========DRAGON===========
    Dragon:As bishop or knight or 2sq orthogonal leap(
    e.g. from d4 to a4,g4,d1,d7).
    

    
    Dragon special moves:
    Dragonflight - can leap over dead squares(2sq ortho).
        
    Conversion:Diagonal(See conversion section).

    Dragon's Fire - capture (3x3) nearby units
    (walls unharmed) when arriving on a empty square.
    CRR & multimove award applies for all units captured.
    example: Dragon arriving at d4(empty), capture
    units at d5,d3,c3,c4,c5,e3,e4,e5.

    Dragon's Egg:Dragon can Lay a single Egg(each dragon can have one Egg on board) in empty, non-threatened square 1sq away from itself(3x3 box).  
    The Egg doesn't move and evolves into Dragon after 60 moves(Growth)
    If there are 4+ Dragons already owned by player, all egg growth stops.
    
    Eggs which are threatened with capture stop their Growth.
    Eggs which are paralyzed reset their growth timer to 0(60 moves).
    Captured Eggs switch sides to capturer side (dead eggs switch side in tomb) and are bound to dragon of players choice(works as if it laid the egg:cannot lay another until the current dies/evolves into dragon).
    Eggs cannot use any ability/move,but can be affected by ability.
    If the dragon that laid the egg dies, the Egg growth is stalled until it respawns.
    Capture MM Awards/CRR for Eggs is same as Pawns.
    Maximum number of Eggs laid per Dragon is 7 after which the Dragon cannot lay more eggs(captured&bound eggs don't count toward limit), but can still Spawn dragons.
    Quickening doubles rate of Growth.

     

    ===========ROOK=============
    Rook:as chess rook(orthogonal)
    Rook Special Moves:
    Stun - when landing on a square,all nearby(3x3)
    enemy units are paralyzed for 2 moves.
    e.g. landing on d4, paralyzesunits at d5,d3,c3,c4,c5,e3,e4,e5.

    Siege - Enemy Units in rooks capture range(one move),
    cannot doublemove/multimove.

    Launch:Throws unit(enemy/friendly) directly forward
    at Aim Direction(thrown units destroy wallsquares
    and other units) until it meets edge of board or obstacle wall/unit which is destroyed in explosion (3x3).
    THe unit which is used as ammo also dies in explosion.(new dead squares).
    e.g. a Rook at d2 launches d3 pawn forward to d7
    where it explodes(3x3) meeting a wall.


    Swipe Paralysis:
    units along the movepath are in paralysis for 1 move(next turn).
    Green=movement, purple=swipe paralysis.
    e.g. rook moving d2-d7, swipes c2-c7/e2-e7 lines.
    Passive:
    Immunity to Push.(passive, in non-box, non-paralysed form.)
  
    ===========QUEEN============

    Queen:as chess rook,bishop or knight(Amazon):
    
    Queen ability:
    Conversion:Diagonal bishop move(See conversion section).

    Queen's Gaze: Pawns in 1sq radius(3x3)
    are paralyzed(automatic,doesn't prevent
    capture by pawn with multimove),cannot use abilities.

    Queen's Poison:Units that captured a queen
    become paralysed for 6 moves.

    Queen's Shadow:At the origin square of move an uncontrolled double of queen is created instead of Wallsquare. It cannot capture/use ability, but can threaten pieces and give check(only as checkthreat, not checkmate).
    The QS disappears on next queen move.

    Queens Illusion(special move):convert last Queen's Shadow to Illusion, queen-movement type unit that cannot attack or use any ability.Not counted as unit in rotate calculations , can be attacked or affected by all abilities(cannot use any ability,except moving:cannot move into occupied/tomb/trap squares  however it will be affected by any traps/effects of its normal movement).Paralysis/Nearby(3x3)Explosion/Attack removes the Illusion unit from the game. 
    Number of QI's cannot exceed the number of player queens. While Illusion is weaker than QShadow, it can be tactically used in some circumstances much more effectively
    as QShadow can't move.

    =================KING==========
    King:moves as chess king(1sq).
    Kings Special Moves:
    King's Check:
    King's check is King-initiated self-check by enemy.
    if the king is not currently in check,
    and moves into check, the checking units die
    (creating dead squares).
    The King's Check cannot be within a
    doublemove(which doesn't allow moving into check)
    or multimove.
    If the king is checked by enemy,
    he cannot move into check
    (must escape checks or use king's exchange).


    King's Exchange:
    Can exchange place with any friendly
    (non-attacked) live unit in the game,
    (exchanged piece dies(creating a dead square under
    King new location after it moves away.))

    King's Portal:if Queen exists King may teleport to square near Queen(3x3) at any time.May not teleport into check or threatened squares.

    Royal Guards:units near king(3x3) cannot
    be paralyzed.(Passive, doesn't remove existing paralysis).

    If king is captured/checkmated/exploded
    the enemy wins.
    Kings are immune to all special
    moves/abilities except Rotate,Explosion and Teleswap(MindControl of Chancellor by enemy and Teleswap).
    Explosion win is much more easily achieved vs checkmate,
    due King's Check and numerous transport options.



    =========JESTER=============
    Moves:
    2sq diagogonaly+optionally 1sq diagonally and optionally 1 sq orthogonally forward(to diagonal direction)
    the move is a leap, skipping units as knight.
    e.g. jester at d5 can move to f7,f8,f3,f2,g3,g4,g6,g7
    e2,e8,c2,c8,b2,b3,b7,b8,a3,a4,a6,a7.
    
    
    Cannot lose Range with CRR.
    jester Special moves:
    jesters cannot capture units.

    jester Power Steal: mimics movement of pieces
    that threaten it
    (can also be empowered at same time,though
    it cannot capture units).

    Jesters Traps:when jesters leaves a square
    during a move, it becomes a trap which
    paralyzes an enemy unit for 4 moves
    (and then dissolves) if stepped on.
    After there are 5 traps on board,
    no more will appear(x5 per each jester,
    10 per 2 jesters,).
    Traps are automatically created with each
    move,if 5 traps already exist the oldest is erased.
    Own units are immune. 
    
    
    Jesters Paralysis: paralyzes nearby units(3x3)
    by presence(units cannot move/use ability,
    but can be influenced by other units).
    Paralysis ends when jesters moves out of range
    or captured(entombed)/paralysed.

    Jesters Explosion:
    Explodes 3x3 when captured(explosion bypasses
    "cannot be captured"/instant checkmate),
    and all adjacent (3x3) squares are cleared
    of units/walls.
    Note:
    Jesters are immune to Jesters Paralysis
    (Kind Immunity) and can move into
    Jesters trapsquares without harm.

    Walltrap: same range as move.
    Surround enemy in 3x3 wall
    (wall dissolves on next jester move),
    Only effective vs lone unit in center of
    3x3. Jester doesn't move at walltrap move
    and next move cancels it.
    

    Detonate:
    Explodes self-as if it was captured,3x3 explosion.
    Available when the jester stays on same place for 10 moves.
    
    Slime explosion; explode 5x5 square centered on jester,
    creating slime(4 move paralysis), jester enters 16 move paralysis.
    
    Distract:
    A jester can Cast(normal move range) distract on a square.
    The affected square(limited to 1 per Jester)
    Will affect movement of line pieces though it(Diagonals/orthogonals enemy/friendly),
    after passing they will bounce on the Square into the direction of Distract,
    Distract Direction:Jester can choose one of 8 directions for the Distract square,which would be followed by Distracted Piece(if the direction is unavailable, closest direction to movement path is selected,the first clockwise direction from the point of view of Distracted Player Piece Side is selected).
    example:
    e.g. a vertical(d-line) distract cast on d4, forces
    units moving through d4 move towards d8 direction
    in same amount of squares as their previous path.
    (if the unit distracted is a bishop, the next clockwise
    diagonal(d4-h8) is its new direction of movement).

    Decoherence:at cost of 5 move paralysis 
    can De-Fuse a fused unit(pieces spread to
    nearby squares (5x5) clockwise from side
    casting at move range.
    cast range is normal move range.


    Spin: The units on 3x3 squares around jester 
    can be rotated clockwise to arbitrary position
    (7 possible spins).
    Unlike rotate The units positions change 
    sequentially from the top one by one.
    e.g. a jester at d4 can rotate all units at
    d5,d3,c3,c4,c5,e3,e4,e5.

    ==========CHANCELLOR=======
    Chancellor:
    1sq in any direction and if the direction
    is orthogonal to center square, 2sq diagonally.
    :described in this picture(center from queen)
    e.g. Chancellor at d4 can move to 
    d5,d3,c3,c4,c5,e3,e4,e5 and b2,b6,f2,f6.
    
    Move and capture identical(can capture at
    all red circles in image).
    
    Special moves:
    Teleswap - Can swap places with any
    friendly piece on the board, even the king.

    Paralyse - Any enemy units in knight range 
    are paralyzed as long as chancellor is alive
    and not paralyzed.
    Range: knight move. Paralysis requires presence
    of unparalysed Chancellor.

    Quickening: Cast(move range) at square
    to alter the time flow in that square.
    THe square will have x2 faster flow of time,
    i.e. paralysis wears off twice faster,
    dragons egg grows twice faster,etc.
    Quickening lasts 64(normal,global player moves)
    moves per square(cumulative with multiple casts,+64),
    and cost 5 paralysis moves for chancellor.
    
    Blizzard:
    Cost: 20 moves paralysis.
    Cast Range 1-5sq diagonally.
    Area(5x5) around center of Blizzard is paralyzed for 4 turns.Affects friendly&enemy units(except kings and the 
    casting Chancellor itself).

    Avalanche:
    Cost: 10 moves paralysis.
    Cast Range as rook movement range(bypasses units).
    All units at line of sight of rook range are pushed to edge of board or first obstacle.
    e.g. a chancellor at d8, will push enemy units
    at d7,d5,d4,d2 into d4,d3,d2,d1.

    Immunity to SwapShot from enemy.
    Immunity to Jesters presence(Jesters paralysis).
   
    special ability:
    Templar's Shield:
    Units cannot capture Chancellor if they
    are in his capture range
    (if a Chancellor can capture your unit
    at the square from where
    you attempt to capture it,
    it cannot capture the Chancellor).
    Range of Shield is 1 normal move without bounce.

    

   


   
   

    =======ADVANCED MOVES===========
    Special Abilities of units are unavailable during advanced movement: exception is attack ability(like conversion/paralysis/capturemove) during multimove, which when used ends multimove.

    Advanced movement:
    Double Move - A unit can do 2 moves per
    turn if they are not captures or
    special moves(i.e.normal moves from A to B).
    Checks/Checkmates are counted as normal moves.



    Diagonal Bounce - chess Bishop-type movement
    can reflect
    off edges of board,dead squares, other units and walls
    (course changes on collision).
    Range of movement is limited by
    16 squares singlemove or 32 sq
    with doublemove.
    e.g. a Bishop at c4, can move c4-a2-b1-g6
    as its path is <16 squares.

    Orthogonal Bounce
    Rook-type movement
    (Rook,Queen,Templar,Crossbowman) can reflect
    off edges of board,dead squares, other units and walls
    (course changes on collision) at 90deg angle.
    Range of movement is limited by
    16 squares singlemove or 32 sq
    with doublemove.
    e.g. a rook moving d1-a1 can move d1-a1-a8
    due bounce(<16sq path) off the a1 edge of board.
   


    ======SPECIAL MOVES & OTHER MECHANICS============
    ---------------------------------
    Special Moves:Mind Control
    MindControl - if pieceA(non-pawn) can capture
    PieceB with orthogonal-direct-line(rook move) without being recaptured(PieceB not protected)
    and both stand on squares of same color,
    it can mindcontrol it instead to make
    any legal move(counts as move of pieceA player).
e.g.a rook at d4 can capture a d2 queen, but instead
he MCs queen to move d2-g2, triggering an explosion which kills it.


    --------------------
    Special Moves:Pull
    if pieceA can capture PieceB with a
    rook-like or bishop-like move:
    PieceA can pull PieceB towards himself
    for N squares.(upto capture range)
    Units that are pulled:any enemy/friendly
    units except:king,units under
    Guards(2+ protectors),
    units inside jesters trapsquares,
    units of same kind(Kind immunity).
    Pull can move units into a Trapsquare.
    After a Pull move:the (puller)
    unit is in paralysis for floor(N/3)
    moves for N squares moved.
    The pulled unit is not affected
    (unless the pull destination is a trap,
    which is treated as PieceB moved into it).
    A pull cannot move pulled unit further if the path
    is occupied by any units/walls, treating the pull
    as normal movement of PieceB obstructed at first
    blocking obstactale.
    

    Pull-through(special pull):
    Units can be pulled even if the there blocking units on the pull path,(the Pulled Unit cannot moves through them, but the force of pull can )
    Example(WKnight pulled by Bishop until it hit a blocking BKnight),Units can be pulled into cannons too.
    After a Pull-through:the (puller)
    unit is in paralysis for floor((2*N)/3)
    moves for N squares moved.
    e.g. a Rook at d2 can Pull through a queen at d7to d5.
    despite a pawn at d4, which would stop a normal pull.



    ------------------
    Special Move:Pushing.
    UnitA can push UnitB in direction of push.
    if it stands orthogonally adjacent in 3x3 square.
    Multiple units/wallsquares can't be pushed.
    Can't push off-board.
    e.g. knight at d4 can push a rook at c5 3sq diagonally
    (as knight range is 3sq) towards a7(d4-c5-a7 direction).
    UnitB push range cannot exceed the UnitA move range
   without UnitB presence(i.e. UnitA move range limit)
     
     

    

    Pushing Walls: wallsquare is moved in 
    orthogonal direction(as if it was an unit) 
    and unit stands in its former place. 
    Unit is paralyzed for 5 moves after wall push.

    =======SHADOW FORM============
    --------------------
    Special Moves: Shadowing/De-Shadowing.
    A non-pawn unit(except King) can turn
    into a Shadow piece(Knight ->ShadowKnight),
    a special piece type that:
    1.Can only capture/affect other shadow pieces
    but can affect them see below:Shadowstrike.
    2.can move in shadow form,
    but every square travelled adds to
    De-Shadow Paralysis penalty.
    3. doesn't block movement(ethereal:
    square can be occupied/moved through by
    other normal pieces and shadows).
    However cannot move through walls,normal units,
    and dead squares.
    4.is limited by Walls and dead squares.
    (but can't create new walls).
    5.Special moves/abilities can only affect other shadow-mode units.
    
    ShadowPiece can return to Normal state
    when its square is not attacked or
    occupied(by normal units,dead squares,walls,traps).
    A minimum delay between turning into
    ShadowPiece and returning back
    to normal is 5 moves.

    De-Shadow Paralysis penalty:
    for N squares travelled in Shadow form,
    the De-shadowed piece is in paralysis for
    floor(N/2) moves(knight move=3sq).

    De-Shadowing move:if conditions are
    satisfied(no threats, empty square),
    player can deshadow the Shadow Piece
    as a special move.

    Shadowstrike: if a normal enemy UnitA is:
    1.unprotected by any unit
    2.on same color square as shadow
    3.is capturable
    shadow unit can shoot at it(via capture move) a shot which converts UnitA to shadowUnitA(forcing shadowing of unit)
    at cost of 10 move paralysis
    (of the Shadowstriker unit).
  
    Note:The game mechanic allows one to deliver
    de-shadowed checkmate, or de-shadow with
    Guards(who can also de-shadow earlier),
    so De-Shadow paralysis is required counterbalance.
    Monad represent a tactical configuration threat 
    which must be countered.

    ----------------------------
    ====CAPTURE==============
    Capture mechanics:
   
    -------------------------
   Dead Squares:
   After any unit has been captured,
   A Dead Square appears at the place 
   instead of Black/White square,
   once the capturer piece leaves(or not present).
   Dead Squares cannot moved into or
   through(except Dragonflight(Dragon passive),
   effectively removing them from the chess board.
  


   

    
    

    ======ROTATE=============
    Special moves:Rotations
    An abstract square(NxN cells) composed
    of board cells can be rotated in
    90deg,180deg and 270deg turn,
    if the player controls the majority
    of units in the square and the units occupy
    boundaries of at least one axis of rotation(i.e.
    the rotated square edges cannot be longer than
    max diagonal/line occupied:e.g. units at d2 and d3 cannot rotate squares with d4, only d2-d3-e3-e3 or d2-d3-c4-c2).
    extremes of rotated object bounds have to be occupied by
    own pieces(as above).
    ----------------------
    majority material points determination:
    values of units are summed and if they're
    larger than enemy you can rotate the square.
    For 300move rule - NxN square is entire board.
    Basic Values of units in points:
    Pawn = 1
    Nightrider,Frog=5
    Crossbowman,Jester,Cannon = 8
    Assassin,Queen,Chancellor=10
    Dragon,Templar,Rook=12
    King =25

    Paralysis exception:units that 
    paralyzed are not counted.

    All shadow units are counted as floor
    (basicvalue/3)+1 and don't gain Rank bonus.

    Color Force bonus:
    All units on square of side color(e.g.black on black)
    multiply basicvalue by2 (basicvalue*2)

    Rank Bonus:half-distance from edge of board
    (own starting side to enemy starting side)
    in squares is added to unit basic value:
    basicvalue+(distance/2:max 8 for 16th file)

    Fuse Bonus:adds number of fused units in unit 
    to global square bonus.

    ----------------------

    After rotation, the (rotated)squares change
    color to align with rest of board.
    Walls and dead squares also rotate
    as well as anything that occurs on the squares.
    Squares(NxN) which touch the edge of board
    can't rotate.
    Size of squares that can be rotated:
    from 2x2 to 8x8 cells;

    =======WALLING============
    Game mechanic: Walls
    PathSquares->WallSquares:
    Unit movement paths become walls:
    When units finish a movement, all squares
    where it was moving(including start squares)
    become wallsquares
    (cannot be landed on or moved through).

    Duration of wall existence:
    Until the waller(wall creator) creates a new wall.
    Then the old wall dissolves(1 wall per unit).
    Some pieces can attack the wallsquare
    (siege-units only:Rook,Cannon)

    Movement near walls:
    if a pathsquare lands on wallsquare,
    the movement cannot proceed.
    Leaping over the wall is allowed
    (no intermediate move may land on wallsquare).
    Exception:
    Assassins entering Wallsquares,move only on Wallsquares.
    
    linear walls:
   e.g. rook moving d2-d8 creates d2-d7 wall.
   biship moving a1-h8, creates a1-g7 wall.
   
    leap wall:1sq (origin square of moved piece, e.g. knight)
  




    ---------------------
    Victory:
    1.if enemy king is checkmated or captured.
    2.enemy stalemate.

    ---------------
    Draw Rules:
    Draw can be obtained by two consecutibe Nullmoves from both players.
    50 moves rule =not enforced
    (easy pawn capture/promotion).
    3fold repetition of position,
    which duplicates the walls/
    paralysis/status is draw
    (exact position duplicate only).
    If a side cannot move(stalemate,rare in FC)
    it loses the game(not a draw).

    Long Games - 300 moves rule(optional):
    After move 300:
    the side with material advantage
    (Rotate Calculations for entire board)
    automatically wins(if Rotate calculation 
    points are larger than enemy by 1 or more).
