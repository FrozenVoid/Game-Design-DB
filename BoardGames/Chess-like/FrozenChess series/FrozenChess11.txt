    ================
    Key mechanics
    ===============
    Paralysis:
    Freezes unit in its place as if it has become a statue of unit.
    Units can't move/capture/use
    abilities while paralyzed for N moves
    (i.e. if they could moves in players turn, they wait until N player turns pass).

    Paralysis Transfer:Any unitA(non-paralyzed(able-to-be paralyzed),not threatened by enemy units) protecting unitB(paralyzed) can take 4 paralysis moves from UnitB as special move.(reduce paralysis penalty by X, by making itself paralyzed for X moves).After being paralyzed unitA(From UnitB) no longer protects and unable to do another paralysis transfer. If UnitB has less than 4 paralysis(moves), UnitA still gets +4 paralysis penalty.
    -------
    Kind Immunity - a non-pawn piece cannot
    engage a piece of its own kind
    (e.g. knight can do nothing to knights)
    with any capture/abilitymove.
    Example:
    https://i.imgur.com/Nvptqqq.png
    Exceptions:pawns,kings(can aid checkmate) and immortal units(frogs/ships).
    ------
    Nullmove:
    A player can perform a Null move, which adds to move count instead of normal move. If two players Nullmove in sequence(two consecutive Nullmoves) game is declared Drawn.
    ----
    Shellshock:
    units passing through threatened squares(1normalmove enemy range) have reduced range at next move.
    range(diagonal/orthogonal rider units)is decreased by 1(normal diag/ortho rider)/2(other moves)/3(explosive/tomb) per each square threatened at next move(e.g. if you pass 5 sq threatened(1sq threatened by rider,1sq by explosion,3sq by other moves), nextmove range is reduced by1+3+6=10(temporary for 1 move)).
    Minimal range is 3 sq beyond which shellshock doesn't reduce range.
    Shellshock disappears after next turn or is replaced by new shellshock modifier(if the unit moves at next turn).

    -------
    Entanglement - Capturing Units of same kind
    (excluding pawns)
    which share a line or diagonal,captures them all.
    Capture multimove award is counted
    as multiple sequential captures,
    CRR reduces as if the capture was one.
    Example:
    https://i.imgur.com/wIjXFve.png
    ----------------------------
    Fusion/De-Fusion -
    Two+ friendly units(except King)(A and B) can fuse into unit AB which has the capabilities of both(can use AB as either unitA or UnitB(for move/capture/ability):
    Enemy can select which of the two units in the AB fused-unit he wants to affect/capture and it affects the entire fused AB unit(e.g. to bypass immunity or secondary effect).
    Fuse: move A into square occupied by B.
    When Captured the Units automatically de-fuse in the tomb, and occupy separate places in Tomb Queues(last unit to fuse-in is added first).The multi-Move awards are reset on de-fuse(from all units in fused unit).

    https://i.imgur.com/uULx5cb.png

    De-fuse: Select(A or B) from AB square
    and move it away(the other units remains at AB square).
    Limit of Units in fused unit:unlimited(e.g. A&B&C&D combine into ABCD unit)
    --------
    Morph - Any unit which is not threatened by enemy units(not in capture area for single move), can transform into another unit (with exception of Kings/pawns which cannot use Morph or be transformed into). The new unit will be in paralysis for 18 moves(bypasses paralysis immunity)..
    Paralyzed,fused,dead,transported,trapped units cannot morph(only normal state units).
    Morph resets all unit stats to default(as if new unit was created in its place).If morphed unit carried any units(transport unit) they die on morph square.

    Restrictions: Morph is restricted for immortal units, max 16 immortal units can exist at same time(e.g. 8 ships+8frogs).
    -----------------------
    Empower - piece which is protected by
    one piece(except Kings/Pawns)) gains its native movement
    and capture ability(Kings/pawns cannot
    be empowered or give empowerment).
    e.g. a knight protected by a rook
    can move and capture like a rook.
    https://i.imgur.com/LihmqRL.png
    Only applies if the empowering unit is not threatened by enemy.
    ------------------------
    Guards - if a unit is protected by
    two or more (non-pawn) pieces it is
    not empowered but cannot be captured
    (can capture normally when guarded).
    Kings cannot be guarded.
    https://i.imgur.com/vSoUmLM.png
    only applies if the guarding units are not threatened by enemy.
    ----------------------------
    SwapShotAny - units(except king) can also swap
    places with units(except king) which they can capture
    (threat of capture,even if unit is friendly).
    e.g. Knight which can capture a pawn can
    swap places with it
    (works within single move only,
    doublemove/multimove range is ignored).
    -------------------------
    Spawn - Any unit(except kings) can spawn
    a copy of itself(new unit of same type) in an empty nearby (3x3) square.
    Both the original unit and the spawn square need not to be threatened by enemy units(even if unit is immortal).
    After spawn both units(the original and copy are paralyzed(bypasses paralysis immunity)) for 40 moves for non-pawn units and 15 for pawns.
    Restrictions: Spawn is restricted for immortal units, max 8 units can exist at same time(e.g. 8 frogs).
    Spawn locations(red=threatened,cannot spawn)
    https://i.imgur.com/iLxlK2j.png
    ---------------
    Capture/Move Range Extension upgrade:Units which can be capture range reduced(CRR applies to them), have the ability to grow base range(16sq diag/ortho).
    For each move the unit doesn't move it get +(1/20)sq base range upgrade(current range is floor(base Range-CRRsq).i.e. Fractional range like 7+3/20 is 7 squares so 20 idle non-moves required to increase by 1 sq.
    The grown range is not limited by board size(16sq) and can exceed it.
    Range Externsion(RE) doesn't reduce after death unlike CRR.CRR is applied after Extension, as Extension modifies the base Range.
    Morph resets Range if the unit morphed into is not a rider unit.

    are paralyzed(automatic,doesn't prevent
    capture by pawn with multimove).

    Queen's Poison:Units that captured a queen
    become paralysed for 6 moves.

    Queen's Shadow:At the origin square of move an uncontrolled double of queen is created instead of Wallsquare. It cannot capture/use ability, but can threaten pieces and give check.
    Example(Yellow=queen,blue=double,black threatened by double,red=threatened by queen):
    https://i.imgur.com/CtG5Z0V.png

    =================KING==========
    King:moves as chess king(1sq).
    Kings Special Moves:
    King's Check:
    King's check is King-initiated self-check by enemy.
    if the king is not currently in check,
    and moves into check, the checking units die
    (creating tomb squares).
    The King's Check cannot be within a
    doublemove(which doesn't allow moving into check)
    or multimove.
    If the king is checked by enemy,
    he cannot move into check
    (must escape checks or use king's exchange).


    King's Exchange:
    Can exchange place with any friendly
    (non-attacked) live unit in the game,
    (exchanged piece dies(creating a tomb under
    King new location. , so each "teleport"
    costs a pawn/piece to make).

    King's Portal:if Queen exists King may teleport to square near Queen(3x3) at any time.May not teleport into check or threatened squares.

    Royal Guards:units near king(3x3) cannot
    be paralyzed.

    If king is captured/checkmated/exploded
    the enemy wins.
    Kings are immune to all special
    moves/abilities except Rotate,Explosion and Teleswap(MindControl of Chancellor by enemy).



    =========JESTER=============

    jester Special moves:
    jesters cannot capture units.

    jester Power Steal: mimics movement of pieces
    that threaten it
    (can also be empowered at same time).

    Jesters Traps:when jesters leaves a square
    during a move, it becomes a trap which
    paralyzes an enemy unit for 4 moves
    (and then dissolves) if stepped on.
    After there are 5 traps on board,
    no more will appear(per each jester,
    10 per 2 jesters,etc).
    Purple=trap, Orange trapped unit(when enters trap)

    Jesters Paralysis: paralyzes nearby units(3x3)
    by presence(units cannot move/use ability,
    but can be influenced by other units)

    Jesters Explosion:
    Explodes 3x3 when captured(explosion bypasses
    "cannot be captured"/instant checkmate),
    and all adjacent (3x3) squares are cleared
    of units/walls, tomb queues are activated.
    Jesters are immune to Jesters Paralysis
    (Kind Immunity) and can move into
    Jesters trapsquares without harm.

    Walltrap: same range as move.
    Surround enemy in 3x3 wall
    (wall dissolves on next jester move),
    if the units is alone:otherwise fills
    empty (3x3) squares with wall:
    https://i.imgur.com/DenGS9n.png

    Detonate:
    Explodes self-as if it was captured,3x3 explosion.
    Available when the jester stays on same place for 10 moves.
    https://i.imgur.com/qdXIIkS.png

    Distract:
    A jester can Cast(normal move range) distract on a square.
    The affected square(limited to 1 per Jester)
    Will affect movement of line pieces though it(Diagonals/orthogonals enemy/friendly),
    after passing they will bounce on the Square into the direction of Distract,
    Distract Direction:Jester can choose one of 8 directions for the Distract square,which would be followed by Distracted Piece(if the direction is unavailable, closest direction to movement path is selected,the first clockwise direction from the point of view of Distracted Player Piece Side is selected).
    example(yellow=movement through Distract,black=distract direction,blue=jesters square)):
    https://i.imgur.com/ljIXZXF.png

    Decoherence:at cost of 5 move paralysis can De-Fuse a fused unit(pieces spread to nearby squares (5x5) clockwise as reverse of Tornado Ability of Templar(in same sequence as Tornado)) at move range.

    Spin: The units on 3x3 squares around jester can be rotated clockwise to arbitrary position(7 possible spins).
    Unlike rotate The units positions change sequentially from the top one by one.(yellow=new spin locations)

    ==========CHANCELLOR=======
    Medium-range spellcaster.
    Chancellor:
    1sq in any direction and if the direction
    is orthogonal to center square, 2sq diagonally.
    :described in this picture(center from queen)
    https://i.imgur.com/PmCMOPx.png
    Cannot lose range with CRR.
    Move and capture identical(can capture at
    all red circles in image).
    Special moves:
    Teleswap - Can swap places with any
    friendly piece on the board, even the king.

    Paralyse - Instead of capturing can cast
    paralyse to enemy unit for 3 moves.

    Quickening: Cast(move range) at square
    to alter the time flow in that square.
    THe square will have x2 faster flow of time, i.e. paralysis wears of twice faster,dragons egg grows twice faster,tombs rot twice faster,Tornado/avalanche last half of time,etc.
    Quickening lasts 64(normal,global player moves) moves per square(cumulative with multiple casts,+64), and cost 5 paralysis moves for chancellor.


    Mirror Portal:
    Teleport(x,y) to Square(16-x,16-y)
    Escape to a square which is a mirror location (as if the white side board rotated 180deg and inserted in the black side) if the mirror square is empty or tomb.
    Colors signify portal squares connection on 8x8 board:
    https://i.imgur.com/xmUCUmD.png
    Portal Protector:
    Can also grant Mirror Portal ability to units which protect the Chancellor(portal is created for the unit square then, not chancellor square).



    Immunity to SwapShot from enemy.
    Immunity to Jesters presence(Jesters paralysis).

    =========TEMPLAR==============
    Long-range suppression unit.
    Templar:as Rook or diagonally 2 squares
    and optionally 1 square diagonally to side.
    T-like capture area.
    described in this image:
    https://i.imgur.com/b8gp86t.png
    Cannot lose non-rook range with CRR.
    special ability:

    Templar's Shield:
    Units cannot capture The Templar if they
    are in his capture range
    (if a templar can capture your unit
    at the square from where
    you attempt to capture it,
    it cannot capture the templar).
    Range of Shield is 1 normal move without bounce.

    If a templar stands on inactive
    Tomb(after capture) the shield is not
    engaged(to allow recapture of templar).
    pic(green sq: cannot capture templar, red=can capture):

    https://i.imgur.com/34jAlHE.png

    Tornado:
    Cost: 20 moves paralysis.
    Cast Range as rook movement range.
    Square Designated as Tornado square becomes a tornado for 10 moves.
    Tornados pull units(5x5 range of effect) 1 sq per move towards the center cell(as if the center of tornado is a puller unit) from all
    directions(orthogonal/diagonal). Tornado example(units stop if the square to which they are pulled is already occupied).
    https://i.imgur.com/Lo0ijl1.png
    order of pull: from closest square clockwise from the point of view of casting side(25-21 row(last units pulled) is aligned to player origin side).
    https://i.imgur.com/7U8cJFF.png

    Avalanche::
    Cost: 10 moves paralysis.
    Cast Range as rook movement range(bypasses units).
    Square Designated as avalanche square becomes a direction of flow for 5 moves.
    Avalanche pushes units 1sq/move away from Templar direction into direction of Avalanche square until there is no possibility of movement forward(units can exit the avalanche flow anytime).
    pueple=pushes units,orange= direction of flow).Units can be pushed into tombs/traps or any square they can normally be pushed by units..
    https://i.imgur.com/TRkUpTq.png




    Immunity to Push.

    =======ADVANCED MOVES===========
    Special Abilities of units are unavailable during advanced movement: exception is attack ability(like conversion/paralysis/capturemove) during multimove, which when used ends multimove.

    Advanced movement:
    Double Move - A unit can do 2 moves per
    turn if they are not captures or
    special moves(i.e.normal moves from A to B).

    Checks/Checkmates are counted as normal moves.

    MultiMove- rewarded for unit captures:
    Multimove nullifies DoubleMove ability
    (as it is an upgraded form) for a piece
    that gets MultiMove..
    It allows N unrestricted moves/specialmoves
    per turn for the unit that possesses the ability.

    Diagonal Bounce - Bishop-type movement
    (Dragon,Queen,Bishop,Ship,) can reflect
    off edges of board, other units and walls
    (course changes on collision).
    Range of movement is limited by
    16 squares singlemove or 32 sq
    with doublemove(less if CRR is in effect).
    Pic:
    https://i.imgur.com/2rKIrcg.png

    Orthogonal Bounce
    Rook-type movement
    (Rook,Queen,Templar,Ship) can reflect
    off edges of board, other units and walls
    (course changes on collision) at 90deg angle.
    Range of movement is limited by
    16 squares singlemove or 32 sq
    with doublemove(less if CRR is in effect).
    Pic:
    https://i.imgur.com/fIeR5C3.png


    ======SPECIAL MOVES============
    ---------------------------------
    Special Moves:Mind Control
    MindControl - if pieceA can capture
    PieceB without being recaptured(PieceB not protected)
    and both stand on squares of same color,
    it can mindcontrol it instead to make
    any legal move(counts as move of pieceA player).

    --------------------
    Special Moves:Pull
    if pieceA can capture PieceB with a
    rook-like or bishop-like move:
    PieceA can pull PieceB towards himself
    for N squares.(upto capture range)
    Units that are pulled:any enemy/friendly
    units except:king,units under
    Guards(2+ protectors),
    units inside jesters trapsquares,
    units of same kind(Kind immunity).
    Pull can move units into a Tomb/Trapsquare.
    After a Pull move:the (puller)
    unit is in paralysis for floor(N/3)
    moves for N squares moved.
    The pulled unit is not affected
    (unless the pull destination is a trap/tomb/etc).
    Pic:
    https://i.imgur.com/i4ra94V.png

    Pull-through:
    Units can be pulled even if the there blocking units on the pull path,(the Pulled Unit cannot moves through them, but the force of pull can )
    Example(WKnight pulled by Bishop until it hit a blocking BKnight),Units can be pulled into ships/cannons too.
    After a Pull-through:the (puller)
    unit is in paralysis for floor((2*N)/3)
    moves for N squares moved.
    https://i.imgur.com/QTifR9Z.png



    ------------------
    Special Move:Pushing.
    UnitA can push UnitB in direction of push.
    if it stands orthogonally adjacent in 3x3 square.
    Multiple units/wallsquares can't be pushed.
    Can't push off-board.

    Push movement(yellow=new pushed unit/wallsquare location,blue=pusher new location):
    https://i.imgur.com/BQgXody.png

    Pushing Walls: wallsquare is moved in orthogonal direction(as if it was an unit) and unit stands in its former place. Unit is paralyzed for 5 moves after wall push.

    =======SHADOW FORM============
    --------------------
    Special Moves: Shadowing/De-Shadowing.
    A non-pawn unit(except King) can turn
    into a Shadow piece(Knight ->ShadowKnight),
    a special piece type that:
    1.Can only capture/affect other shadow pieces
    (they become trapped in normal
    tombsquares if they die),
    but can affect them see below:Shadowstrike.
    2.can move in shadow form,
    but every square travelled adds to
    De-Shadow Paralysis penalty.
    3. doesn't block movement(ethereal:
    square can be occupied/moved through by
    other normal pieces and shadows).
    However cannot move through walls,normal units, and tombs(Cannot enter tomb square).
    4.is affected by Tombs and Walls
    (but can't create new walls).
    5.Cannot use unit-specific
    abilities(special moves bound to unit) in shadowform which affect the normal units or the board.

    ShadowPiece can return to Normal state
    when its square is not attacked or
    occupied(by normal units,tombs,walls,traps).
    A minimum delay between turning into
    ShadowPiece and returning back
    to normal is 5 moves.

    De-Shadow Paralysis penalty:
    for N squares travelled in Shadow form,
    the De-shadowed piece is in paralysis for
    floor(N/2) moves(knight move=3sq).

    De-Shadowing move:if conditions are
    satisfied(no threats, empty square),
    player can deshadow the ShadowPiece
    as a special move.

    Shadowstrike: if a normal enemy UnitA is:
    1.unprotected by any unit
    2.on same color square as shadow
    3.is capturable
    shadow unit can shoot at it(via capture move) a shot which converts UnitA to shadowUnitA
    at cost of 10 move paralysis
    (of the Shadowstriker unit).
    ---------Shadow Monads----------
    Monads: Shadowed pieces may enter Monad state which they cannot leave by themself. Monads cannot be captured/paralyzed and are immune to all special moves/ability aimed at them until they end their move sequence..
    Monad state:
    1.Player first enters a sequence of 1 to 16 moves, which will be performed in shadow-form(future moves).
    Moves can include De-shadowing and any special ability(Paralysis applies normally for use of De-shadow/ability)
    2.Piece Enters a Monad state, where it cannot move/use ability/capture.
    3.After Monad is activated, the player Loses control of the piece,
    as it performs the moves in #1 in Monad sequence inside consecutive Multi-moves.
    ,if they are illegal the piece is paralyzed until they become legal.
    Multi-move Monad(2+ move sequence):
    The move sequence is done within one move,until the move is illegal to make.
    When the move becomes legal the sequence continues,as if it was interrupted multi-move.
    4.If N moves pass(x3 the remaining sequence moves(48 for 16 moves remaining))
    while the piece is paralyzed due Monad sequence being unable to complete(illegal moves), it dies and tomb square is created..
    5.After all the moves are done the piece is free to go(to be controlled by player).
    6.At all times the Monad sequence of moves is visible to enemy players and cannot change once created.Moves of monad are independent of player and occur after enemy moves.

    Monad Activation:
    When a normal enemy piece(incl.pawns) at the square the Monad occupies is shadowformed/shadowstriken.(since normal units can move into Monad square as its a shadow piece).
    Monad activation can be also done by pulling/moving enemy shadow piece to Monad square with any method.
    The piece in Activated Monad cannot be captured/paralyzed by enemy units(tombs/walls work normally) but can be affected by square-target ability(if moved from sequence moves path, its next moves would be automatic: a series of moves which are the shortest path to square fron which it was moved).



    Note:The game mechanic allows one to deliver
    de-shadowed checkmate, or de-shadow with
    Guards(who can also de-shadow earlier),
    so De-Shadow paralysis is required counterbalance.Monad represent a tactical configuration threat which must be countered.

    ----------------------------
    ====CAPTURE==============
    Capture mechanics:
    1.Capture Range Reduction - ranged pieces
    (diagonal/orthogonal moves like rook and bishop)
    normally have 16 squares range(per move),
    but after a capture this range
    (used single move/capture) is reduced by
    3 for non-pawn capture and
    1 for pawn capture.
    (until 3 square minimum range:
    if e.g. remaining range is 4,
    with capture of knight(-3) its becomes 3).
    CRR resets on respawn.

    2.Capture Multimove Award:If a non-pawn
    piece captures 3 non-pawns or
    10 pawns(separate counters for each)
    it gets +1 move(multimove ability upgrade),
    repeated for each series of captures
    (+1 extra move per 3or10).
    MultiMove ability is retained within tombs.

    ---------------------
    Visual:
    Current Range of piece could be shown
    as number(1-length_of_board,3 for knight)
    on the unit center(software),with green number
    as paralysis movecount.
    Multimove Ability will be represented
    as yellow glow(2 moves),
    orange glow(3 moves) and
    red glow(for 4 and more moves per turn).
    --------Post-capture--------
    2.Tomb Squares - When a unit is captured,
    as soon as the capturer leaves the square
    empty(no wall or any units) it becomes
    a tomb containing the captured piece(s)
    FIFO queue which can respawn
    if the conditions are met.
    Pieces which moved over
    (squares of path land on tomb) a Tomb square,
    become paralyzed for the next move
    (next move must be played by other pieces).
    ------
    Tomb FIFO queue - first unit to get out
    are the first to get in(FIFO),
    and tomb square returns to its Tomb status
    (exploding square vs square with piece)
    as soon as the respawned piece left,
    the square is empty and there are
    more units in the tomb queue.
    If the tomb queue is cleared
    (can happen by nearby explosion clearing the tomb),
    with last unit leaving it becomes a normal
    square again.

    -----
    Tomb Square explosion: if a piece steps
    on a tomb square it explodes
    (adding the unit to the tomb FIFO queue),
    clearing (3x3) nearby squares
    (tombs created for killed units ,
    walls disappear,kings checkmated if in range),
    and oldest FIFO unit is
    eligible for respawn move.
    Explosion:
    https://i.imgur.com/ZIesFYJ.png
    ----------
    Corrupted Squares:
    if a square has Tombs which exploded 5 times in the game, the square becomes a Corrupted Square which kills any unit that land on it or pass through it(diag/ortho move), permanently (permadeath,cannot respawn, no tomb is created).


    -------------------------
    Tomb Rot: If the Tomb isn't guarded(in capture range of at least one unit) it rots(counter resets if guarded) in 40 moves and explodes 3x3:
    After which tomb queue is activated and
    first unit in the queue can respawn
    on the square(player is notified of such capability).
    It returns to explosive Tomb status as the respawned unit leaves(re-activation,Tomb Rot counter start again if not guarded).

    -------------------------------------
    Special Moves:Respawn
    Respawn - Dead units can respawn if their
    Tomb square (of their last square in life
    if pushed off-board)
    explodes and not threatened by any piece
    (cannot be captured/exploded/immobilized/
    influenced by enemy unit on next move)
    in order of their deaths(oldest first).
    Counts as players move
    (choose available respawn square).
    Respawned units range is reset to
    default(CRR removed).

    respawn examples:
    Single Capture:
    queen captures a rook at a1,
    as queen leaves a1 it becomes a tomb square
    (containing a rook).
    now a knight jumps into a1, and it
    explodes(3x3 clear),but a1 is targeted by
    queen, so rook can't appear.
    When queen leaves guarding a1.
    Player can respawn the rook at a1,
    after rooks leaves a1 becomes a
    tomb square containing a knight,
    and the process repeats ad infinitum.
    (If queen was recaptured its added to
    tomb queue after the rook.)

    ======ROTATE=============
    Special moves:Rotations
    An abstract square(NxN cells) composed
    of board cells can be rotated in
    90deg,180deg and 270deg turn,
    if the player controls the majority
    of units in the square:
    ----------------------
    majority determination:
    values of units are summed and if they're
    larger than enemy you can rotate the square.

    Paralysis exception:units that are
    inside ships/cannons,dead or
    paralyzed are not counted.
    All shadow units are counted as pawns(regardless of rank).


    Color Force:
    when on squares which are
    same as own side color(e.g. white on white squares) a unit is counted as x2 same unit for the calculation of rotate majority.

    Rank:King/Queen/FusedUnit=3,Pawn/Shadow=1,other=2;
    all x2(6,2,4) with Color Force bonus.

    ----------------------

    After rotation, the (rotated)squares change
    color to align with rest of board.
    Walls and tomb squares also rotate
    as well as anything that occurs on the squares.
    Squares(NxN) which touch the edge of board
    can't rotate.
    Size of squares that can be rotated:
    from 2x2 to 8x8 cells;

    =======WALLING============
    Game mechanic: Walls
    PathSquares->WallSquares:
    Unit movement paths become walls:
    When units finish a movement, all squares
    where it was moving(including start squares)
    become wallsquares
    (cannot be landed on or moved through).

    Duration of wall existence:
    Until the waller(wall creator) creates a new wall.
    Then the old wall dissolves.
    Some pieces can attack the wallsquare
    (siege-units only:Onager,Cannon,Ram,Trebuchet)

    Movement near walls:
    if a pathsquare lands on wallsquare,
    the movement cannot proceed.
    Leaping over the wall is allowed
    (no intermediate move may land on wallsquare).
    Exception:
    Assassins entering Wallsquares,move only on Wallsquares.
    linear walls:

    ---------------------
    Victory:
    1.if enemy king is checkmated or captured.
    2.enemy stalemate.

    ---------------
    Draw Rules:
    Draw can be obtained by two consecutibe Nullmoves from both players.
    50 moves rule =not enforced
    (easy pawn capture/promotion).
    3fold repetition of position,
    which duplicates the walls/tombsquares/
    paralysis/status is draw
    (exact position duplicate only,
    ranges of units and tomb queues).
    If a side cannot move(stalemate,rare in FC) it loses the game(not a draw).

    Long Games:
    Sudden Death Principle:
    The game becomes easier to Win to avoid long games.
    --
    After move 300, the game can come to a sudden end if the right Victory Sequence is obtained by the side with the most material value.
    Stage1:
    The units material counts are same as Rotate Calculations for the whole board.
    Stage2:
    The material majority side at move 300,
    Can now obtain victory sequence with three conditions(can do them in any order or time(unlimited moves) as long as the material advantage exists) after move 300:
    1.Capture two enemy units sequentially
    (two moves, each of them a capture)
    2.Promote a pawn(last line or Piece promotion).
    (pawn doesn't need to live to satisfy the condition)
    3.Check the king twice sequentially.
    (two moves, two checks)
    As material value changes the stronger side determination: conditions reset(i.e. conditions must be fulfilled during the sequence uninterrupted: any time side loses material advantage the sequences must be redone).
    Stage3:
    If the game reaches move 600 without victory.
    1.The majority of material side gains the following: (as long as it has majority) Ability to control Tombs(explode at will).
    2.Unrestricted Double-Move(can capture within doublemove).
    3.Spawn Paralysis reduced to 5 moves.
    4.Kings gain ability to construct Wonder.
    Wonder:special units which when existing
    for 50 moves(25 with Quickening)(Build time) wins the games(if both complete equally, they disappear and next wonder wins).
    can be Spawned(at no cost) by King at nearby(3x3) square, cannot be Guarded, doesn't move,can be exploded/captured.Paralysis of Wonder stops(temporary) Build time.
    Max 4 wonders on board per side.
    Stage4:
    If the Game reaches move 900,
    1.the pieces gain Atomic bonus (similar to Atomic Chess) which makes them
    explode on capture/paralysis 3x3(explosion kills all units,pawns included).
    2.All new captures are permadeath: no new tombs will appear.

    Stage5:
    If the game reaches move 1200 without a winner, the Kings gain the following abilities
    1.Unrestricted triple move, can capture enemy kings.
    2.Knight and Bishop movement.
    3.Mirror Portal ability.
    4.Ability to Spawn pawns as special move(at no paralysis cost).
    5.Squares from which King moved get converted into Corrupted Squares.
    Stage6:
    After move 1500, the games enters
    SMV(Superior Material Value) conditions:the side which obtains any material advantage (as in Rotate Calculations for board) automatically wins as soon as SMV is obtained.
