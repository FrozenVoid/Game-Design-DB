    --Changes from v7--
    Walls are player controlled.
    16 new units. Entanglement added.
    Minor mechanics/units changes(nerfed push)

    --Game principles--

    Paralysis:Units can't move/check/capture/use
    abilities while paralyzed for N moves
    (i.e. if they could moves in players turn,
    they wait until N player turns pass).
    -------
    Kind Immunity - a non-pawn piece cannot
    engage a piece of its own kind
    (e.g. knight can do nothing to knights)
    with any capture/abilitymove.
    Example:
    https://i.imgur.com/sQ5LWkC.png
    ------
    Entanglement - Capturing Units of same kind
    (excluding pawns)
    which share a line or diagonal,captures them all.
    Capture multimove award is counted
    as multiple sequential captures,
    CRR reduces as if the capture was one.
    Example:

    ======UNIT TYPE==================
    Siege Units(4):Units that can attack walls:
    Ram,Trebuchet,Cannon,Onager

    Leapers(8):
    Units can leap over units and walls/tombs.
    Queen(Knightmove),Knight,Dragon(knightmove),
    Chancellor,Jester,Templar,Frog.
    Every other unit doesn't leap.

    Riders(7):
    Units that can move in
    one direction to maximum range:
    Ship,Onager,Rook,Bishop,Queen,Dragon,Templar,Lancer.

    Transports(2):
    Can hold units in itself:
    Ship(8),Cannon(1).

    Immobile(2):
    Cannot move by itself:
    Trebuchet,Cannon.

    Immortal(2);
    neutral units that cannot be captured.
    Frog,Ship.

    High-value Units(9):
    Units that are considered the most powerful:
    Queen(range),Templar(shield), Chancellor(teleswap),
    Rook(stun),Trebuchet(explosion),Bishop(conversion),
    Ballista(paralysis),Jester(paralysis/explodes),Dragon(Dragon's Fire).

    Capture Range Reduction units(6):
    These units lose their
    (Diagonal/orthogonal) range after captures:
    Rook(ortho),Queen(Diag/ortho),Bishop(diag),
    Templar(ortho),Dragon(diag),Lancer(diag).

    -==Units and their moves==
    ==========PAWN==========
    Pawn:as chess pawn+can leap forward
    (over a unit directly above) 1 sq.
    https://i.imgur.com/lqKMOnE.png
    Pawn special Moves:

    Piece Promotion: capturing a non-pawn
    piece promotes the pawn into the
    same kind of piece.
    (capture a knight to get a knight)
    https://i.imgur.com/ja9tyjY.png

    Last File promotion:
    pawns at last file, promote to any pieces
    except king and pawn.


    Pawn Acceleration:for each capture of pawn
    in pawn form,pawn gains +1 move per turn.
    (i.e. non-restricted multi-move for pawn).
    The ability to multimove stops on promotion,
    but not capture(tomb square).

    Pawn Spawn:Special move(empty square required):
    A pawnA can spawn another pawnB directly at
    cell below itself(in the direction of retreat),
    at cost of 12 move paralysis for both pawns.
    https://i.imgur.com/0erG9TU.png

    https://i.imgur.com/0ZRJSDW.png
    Leaped over units(orange=leapcapture,red=capture):
    https://i.imgur.com/falp3A4.png

    Knight Special Moves:
    Knight's Leap - Knight can capture by
    leaping over(must be under one of paths of leap)
    pieces as if it was a normal capture
    (landing on empty squares),
    even within double move(capture ends movement,
    cannot capture more than one piece).

    Knight's March: Can move 4 moves in a turn
    if no capture occurs.
    Knight Range(red1,Yellow2,Blue3 moves)
    https://i.imgur.com/yADQp0C.png

    or 1sq orthogonally. Moves::
    https://i.imgur.com/dMOM8vu.png
    Capture:Conversion ability-only.
    Bishop:special moves;
    Conversion: if not during double move,

    Dragon special moves:

    Dragon's Fire - capture (3x3) nearby units
    (Tombs/walls unharmed) when arriving on a empty square.
    CRR & multimove award applies for all units captured.
    https://i.imgur.com/6lmOVy3.png


    Dragonflight - can move over/near Tombs
    without paralysis.

    ===========ROOK=============
    Rook:as chess rook(orthogonal)
    Rook Special Moves:
    Stun - when landing on a square,all nearby(3x3)
    enemy units are paralyzed for 2 moves.
    https://i.imgur.com/9t4d27d.png

    Siege - Enemy Units in rooks capture range,
    cannot doublemove.


    Tower:Units which are empowering
    (by singlemove range) a Rook,
    get Empowered(rook move) back.
    https://i.imgur.com/wPATXSl.png

    ===========QUEEN============
    Queen:as chess rook,bishop or knight(Amazon):
    https://i.imgur.com/U1lNRqD.png
    Queen ability:

    Queen's Gaze: Pawns in 1sq radius(3x3)
    are paralyzed(automatic,doesn't prevent
    capture by pawn with multimove).

    Queen's Poison:Units that captured a queen
    become paralysed for 6 moves.

    =================KING==========
    King:moves as chess king(1sq).
    Kings Special Moves:
    King's Check:
    King's check is King-initiated self-check by enemy.
    if the king is not currently in check,
    and moves into check, the checking units die
    (creating tomb squares).
    The King's Check cannot be within a
    doublemove(which doesn't allow moving into check)
    or multimove.
    If the king is checked by enemy,
    he cannot move into check
    (must escape checks or use king's exchange).


    King's Exchange:
    Can exchange place with any friendly
    (non-attacked) live unit in the game,
    (exchanged piece dies(creating a tomb under
    King new location. , so each "teleport"
    costs a pawn/piece to make).

    Royal Guards:units near king(3x3) cannot
    be paralyzed.

    If king is captured/checkmated/exploded
    the enemy wins.
    Kings are immune to most special
    move abilities(SwapShot/Paralysis/Mind Control/
    Dragons Fire/immobilization/conversion/etc),
    but can be Rotated within squares.
    (Teleswap works on friendly king)



    =========JESTER=============
    Moves: 2sq diag+optionally 1sq to side:
    diagonally and 1 sq orthogonally forward.
    described in this image:
    https://i.imgur.com/NfAVWDb.png
    Cannot lose Range with CRR.
    jester Special moves:
    jesters cannot capture units.

    jester Power Steal: mimics movement of pieces
    that threaten it
    (can also be empowered at same time).

    Jesters Traps:when jesters leaves a square
    during a move, it becomes a trap which
    paralyzes an enemy unit for 4 moves
    (and then dissolves) if stepped on.
    After there are 5 traps on board,
    no more will appear(per each jester,
    10 per 2 jesters,etc).

    Jesters Paralysis: paralyzes nearby units(3x3)
    by presence(units cannot move/use ability,
    but can be influenced by other units)

    Jesters Explosion:
    Explodes 3x3 when captured(explosion bypasses
    "cannot be captured"/instant checkmate),
    and all adjacent (3x3) squares are cleared
    of units/walls, tomb queues are activated.
    Jesters are immune to Jesters Paralysis
    (Kind Immunity) and can move into
    Jesters trapsquares without harm.

    Walltrap: same range as move.
    Surround enemy in 3x3 wall
    (wall dissolves on next jester move),
    if the units is alone:otherwise fills
    empty (3x3) squares with wall:
    https://i.imgur.com/DenGS9n.png

    ==========CHANCELLOR=======
    Chancellor:
    1sq in any direction and if the direction
    is orthogonal to center square, 2sq diagonally.
    :described in this picture(center from queen)
    https://i.imgur.com/PmCMOPx.png
    Cannot lose range with CRR.
    Move and capture identical(can capture at
    all red circles in image).
    Special moves:
    Teleswap - Can swap places with any
    friendly piece on the board, even the king.
    Paralyse - Instead of capturing can cast
    paralyse to enemy unit for 3 moves.
    Immunity to SwapShot from enemy.
    Immunity to Jesters presence(Jesters paralysis).

    =========TEMPLAR==============
    Templar:as Rook or diagonally 2 squares
    and optionally 1 square diagonally to side.
    T-like capture area.
    described in this image:
    https://i.imgur.com/b8gp86t.png
    Cannot lose non-rook range with CRR.
    special ability:
    Templar's Shield:
    Units cannot capture The Templar if they
    are in his capture range
    (if a templar can capture your unit
    at the square from where
    you attempt to capture it,
    it cannot capture the templar).
    If a templar stands on inactive
    Tomb(after capture) the shield is not
    engaged(to allow recapture of templar).

    Immunity to Push.

    =======ADVANCED MOVES===========
    Advanced movement:
    Double Move - A unit can do 2 moves per
    turn if they are not captures or
    special moves(i.e.normal moves from A to B).

    Checks/Checkmates are counted as normal moves.

    MultiMove- rewarded for unit captures:
    Multimove nullifies DoubleMove ability
    (as it is an upgraded form) for a piece
    that gets MultiMove..
    It allows N unrestricted moves/specialmoves
    per turn for the unit that possesses the ability.

    Diagonal Bounce - Bishop-type movement
    (Dragon,Queen,Bishop,Ship,) can reflect
    off edges of board, other units and walls
    (course changes on collision).
    Range of movement is limited by
    16 squares singlemove or 32 sq
    with doublemove(less if CRR is in effect).
    Pic:
    https://i.imgur.com/2rKIrcg.png

    ======SPECIAL MOVES============
    ---------------------------------
    Special Moves:Mind Control
    MindControl - if pieceA can capture
    PieceB without being recaptured,
    it can mindcontrol it instead to make
    any legal move(counts as move of pieceA player).
    --------------------
    Special Moves:Pull
    if pieceA can capture PieceB with a
    rook-like or bishop-like move:
    PieceA can pull PieceB towards himself
    for N squares.(upto capture range)
    Units that are pulled:any enemy/friendly
    units except:king,units under
    Guards(2+ protectors),
    units inside jesters trapsquares,
    units of same kind(Kind immunity).
    Pull can move units into a Tomb/Trapsquare.
    After a Pull move:the (puller)
    unit is in paralysis for floor(N/3)
    moves for N squares moved.
    The pulled unit is not affected
    (unless the pull destination is a trap/tomb/etc).
    Pic:
    https://i.imgur.com/i4ra94V.png
    ------------------
    Special Move:Pushing.
    UnitA can push enemy UnitB
    if it stands orthogonally in 3x3 square.
    Multiple units can't be pushed.
    Can't push off-board.

    Push movement:
    https://i.imgur.com/pS5mMoj.png

    --------------------
    Special Moves: Shadowing/De-Shadowing.
    A non-pawn unit(except King) can turn
    into a Shadow piece(Knight ->ShadowKnight),
    a special piece type that:
    1.Can only capture other shadow pieces
    (they become trapped in normal
    tombsquares if they die).
    2.can move in shadow form,
    but every square travelled adds to
    De-Shadow Paralysis penalty.
    3. doesn't block movement(ethereal:
    square can be occupied/moved through by
    other normal pieces).
    4.is affected by Tombs and Walls
    (but can't create walls).
    5.Cannot use unit-specific
    abilities(special moves) in shadowform.

    ShadowPiece can return to Normal state
    when its square is not attacked or
    occupied(by normal units,tombs,walls,traps).
    A minimum delay between turning into
    ShadowPiece and returning back
    to normal is 5 moves.

    De-Shadow Paralysis penalty:
    for N squares travelled in Shadow form,
    the De-shadowed piece is in paralysis for
    floor(N/2) moves(knight move=3sq).

    De-Shadowing move:if conditions are
    satisfied(no threats, empty square),
    player can deshadow the ShadowPiece
    as a special move.

    Note:The game mechanic allows one to deliver
    de-shadowed checkmate, or de-shadow with
    Guards(who can also de-shadow earlier),
    so De-Shadow paralysis is required counterbalance.

    ----------------------------
    ====CAPTURE==============
    Capture mechanics:
    1.Capture Range Reduction - ranged pieces
    (diagonal/orthogonal moves like rook and bishop)
    normally have 16 squares range(per move),
    but after a capture this range
    (used single move/capture) is reduced by
    3 for non-pawn capture and
    1 for pawn capture.
    (until 3 square minimum range:
    if e.g. remaining range is 4,
    with capture of knight(-3) its becomes 3).
    CRR resets on respawn.

    2.Capture Multimove Award:If a non-pawn
    piece captures 3 non-pawns or
    10 pawns(separate counters for each)
    it gets +1 move(multimove ability upgrade),
    repeated for each series of captures
    (+1 extra move per 3or10).
    MultiMove ability is retained within tombs.

    ---------------------
    Visual:
    Current Range of piece could be shown
    as number(1-length_of_board,3 for knight)
    on the unit center(software),with green number
    as paralysis movecount.
    Multimove Ability will be represented
    as yellow glow(2 moves),
    orange glow(3 moves) and
    red glow(for 4 and more moves per turn).
    --------Post-capture--------
    2.Tomb Squares - When a unit is captured,
    as soon as the capturer leaves the square
    empty(no wall or any units) it becomes
    a tomb containing the captured piece(s)
    FIFO queue which can respawn
    if the conditions are met.
    Pieces which moved over
    (squares of path land on tomb) a Tomb square,
    become paralyzed for the next 2 moves
    (next 2 moves must be played by other pieces).
    ------
    Tomb FIFO queue - first unit to get out
    are the first to get in(FIFO),
    and tomb square returns to its Tomb status
    (exploding square vs square with piece)
    as soon as the respawned piece left,
    the square is empty and there are
    more units in the tomb queue.
    If the tomb queue is cleared
    (can happen by nearby explosion clearing the tomb),
    with last unit leaving it becomes a normal
    square again.

    -----
    Tomb Square explosion: if a piece steps
    on a tomb square it explodes
    (adding the unit to the tomb FIFO queue),
    clearing (3x3) nearby squares
    (tombs created for killed units ,
    walls disappear,kings checkmated if in range),
    and oldest FIFO unit is
    eligible for respawn move.
    Explosion:
    https://i.imgur.com/ZIesFYJ.png
    -------------------------------------
    Special Moves:Respawn
    Respawn - Dead units can respawn if their
    Tomb square (of their last square in life
    if pushed off-board)
    explodes and not threatened by any piece
    (cannot be captured/exploded/immobilized/
    influenced by enemy unit on next move)
    in order of their deaths(oldest first).
    Counts as players move
    (choose available respawn square).
    Respawned units range is reset to
    default(CRR removed).

    respawn examples:
    Single Capture:
    queen captures a rook at a1,
    as queen leaves a1 it becomes a tomb square
    (containing a rook).
    now a knight jumps into a1, and it
    explodes(3x3 clear),but a1 is targeted by
    queen, so rook can't appear.
    When queen leaves guarding a1.
    Player can respawn the rook at a1,
    after rooks leaves a1 becomes a
    tomb square containing a knight,
    and the process repeats ad infinitum.
    (If queen was recaptured its added to
    tomb queue after the rook.)

    ======ROTATE=============
    Special moves:Rotations
    An abstract square(NxN cells) composed
    of board cells can be rotated in
    90deg,180deg and 270deg turn,
    if the player controls the majority
    of units in the square:
    ----------------------
    majority determination:
    values of units are summed and if they're
    larger than enemy you can rotate the square.

    Paralysis exception:units that are
    inside ships/cannons,dead,shadowform or
    paralyzed are not counted.

    Color Force:when on squares which are
    same as own side color(e.g. white on white squares) a unit is counted as x2 same unit for the calculation of rotate majority.
    Rank:King/Queen=3,Pawn=1,other=2;
    all x2(6,2,4) with Color Force bonus.

    ----------------------

    After rotation, the (rotated)squares change
    color to align with rest of board.
    Walls and tomb squares also rotate
    as well as anything that occurs on the squares.
    Squares(NxN) which touch the edge of board
    can't rotate.
    Size of squares that can be rotated:
    from 2x2 to 8x8 cells;

    =======WALLING============
    Game mechanic: Walls
    PathSquares->WallSquares:
    Unit movement paths become walls:
    When units finish a movement, all squares
    where it was moving(including start squares)
    become wallsquares
    (cannot be landed on or moved through).

    Duration of wall existence:
    Until the waller(wall creator) creates a new wall.
    Then the old wall dissolves.
    Some pieces can attack the wallsquare
    (siege-units only:Onager,Cannon,Ram,Trebuchet)

    Movement near walls:
    if a pathsquare lands on wallsquare,
    the movement cannot proceed.
    Leaping over the wall is allowed
    (no intermediate move may land on wallsquare).
    linear walls:

    leap wall:
    https://i.imgur.com/U0UEyPy.png


    ===UNIT PROTECTION MECHANICS===
    -----------------------
    Empower - piece which is protected by
    one piece gains its native movement
    and capture ability(Kings/pawns cannot
    be empowered or give empowerment).
    e.g. a knight protected by a rook
    can move and capture like a rook.
    ------------------------
    Guards - if a unit is protected by
    two or more (non-pawn) pieces it is
    not empowered but cannot be captured
    (the guarded unit can capture normally).
    Kings cannot be guarded.
    ========SWAPSHOT===========
    ----------------------------
    SwapShotAny- Non-pawn Pieces can also swap
    places with units which they can capture
    (threat of capture,even if unit is friendly).
    e.g. Knight which can capture a pawn can
    swap places with it
    (works within single move only,
    doublemove range is ignored).
    Kings cannot be SwapShotted,
    only use kings exchange.

    ------------------
    First move:Side which moves first in
    the game can only make a normal
    pawn move as first move.(no special moves)


    ---------------------
    Victory:
    1.if enemy king is checkmated or captured.
    2.enemy stalemate.


    Draw Rules:
    50 moves rule =not enforced
    (easy pawn capture/promotion).
    3fold repetition of position,
    which duplicates the walls/tombsquares/
    paralysis/status is draw
    (exact position duplicate only,
    ranges of units and tomb queues).
    If a side cannot move(stalemate)
    it loses the game(not a draw).
