In this variant a piece can
 promote to its captured unit 
 piece-type if the player
 wants it.
 e.g. Queen capturing knight will not promote
 to a Knight, but player might
 promote a knight capturing bishop
 to a Bishop.

Variations:
A popular variant is to 
use this for pawn promotions only, with pawn assuming form of any captured piece at its square.
