Move generation can be sped up, 
by switching off features at compile time,
Creating multiple varitions of move generation
function that exclude castling, en passant, 
specific piece types,etc

Example:
Castling switch off:
a search from a position that has no 
castling opportunity can switch permanently
to "CastlingLess movegen" that doesn't 
consider the Castling as a boolean constant
that is "false" at start of function
e.g. template <bool HasCastling>
