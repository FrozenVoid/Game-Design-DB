A wall-generator unit is capable
of creating a temporary obstacle 
wall(which is retained until
specific condition is met:
e.g. unit moving again or N moves 
of player), that is created
over the square of its movement
path:
e.g. moving from d1 to d4 will
create a wall in d1,d2,d3.

Variations:
1.Destructible wall:
Wall can be targeted by spells/abilities
of units but cannot be moved into.
2.Walkable wall:
Unit can climb up/down the wall
as separate move requiring
proximity to wall square,
which also allows movement
inside walls.
