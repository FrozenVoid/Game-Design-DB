A leaper unit is any piece(e.g. Knight)
that can moves over obstacles
from start square(jump square)
to its destination square unaffected
by intermediate terrain.

Type of leaper pieces:
1.Standard pattern:
A leaper has a symmetric(usually 4-8)
square grid of possible jump destinations
which represent its range of movement.
2.Capture-type:
A leaper that gains its leaping
 ability from capturing units:
 usually 1 leap per capture,
 with normal movement usually being non-leaping.
3.Cast to square:
A leaper with ability(with cooldown)
to teleport to any square,
usually with restriction on 
further movement to balance this power.

4.Leap-capture:
The units being leaped over are
captured by leaper. The destination square
can also be a target of capture,
but cannot be combined with leap-capture

5.Assisted leap:
Unit gains its leap ability
due being in range of some helper unit
or under a spell effect.
