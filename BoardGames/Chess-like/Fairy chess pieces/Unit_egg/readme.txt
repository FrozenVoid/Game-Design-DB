Unit egg is a typically
 defenseless, non-moving piece that will
 transform into its full unit form after
  N moves of player.
  
A typical example is a dragon egg:
placed on a square, it cannot move
or do anything but hatch after N moves
 pass from its placement move, 
 into a dragon piece.
 
Rarely a spell can turn units
into their egg-form or accelerate hatching time.
