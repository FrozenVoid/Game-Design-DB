A push/pull unit can drag
other units(not necessary allied)
with its movement towards a valid 
square aligned with destination 
square.
Typical example is a Rook-type
unit pushing a unit in its path
forwards into movement direction
or pulling a unit just behind itself
toward the same direction.

Variations:
1.Off-board pusher:
This type can push units
off board, which is equivalent to
capture.
2.Chain-puller:
can pull multiple units linked
to its starting square.
3.Line-pusher:unit can push
all units on the same line/diagonal
 up to the edge of board.
