An infection unit is a piece under
a spell that spreads its spell-effect
to any touched unit(1sq range).
Usually the effect is stasis/paralysis
type that prevent further movement.

The side with infection-unit can
 revert the piece to its normal state,
 with some cooldown to reuse the ability.

Usually an infection unit has
limited move/infection range 
and requires being converted
into infection units close
to enemy pieces.



Variations:
1.Morphing infection:
Infected units are morphed
into infection-unit piece type,
optionally switching sides.
2.Egg-type conversion:
Infected units are converted to eggs
of their piece-type and switch sides
to infection-unit side.
3.Chain infection:
Units in proximity to
 infected units up to N pieces are
 also infected if squares touch.
