A unit cannon is a piece that
shoots units.
Typically an 'ammo' unit(usually
a low-rank/pawn unit) is pulled
 or steps itself into cannon piece
 square to charge the cannon.
After charge, the unit-cannon
can shoot the piece towards
its destination square in attack range.

Variations:
1.Exploding unit:
the unit being shot explodes in 3x3
 range of destination, killing all pieces
 in 3x3 range.
2.Portal cannon:
the unit being shot
arrives unharmed as if by portal.
3.Spell-cannon: unit-cannon
uses the unit as fuel to cast
some spell on target area.
The unit being 'shot' is consumed
in process as in #1.
