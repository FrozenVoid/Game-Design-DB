A shadow unit is a property of a
 piece that allows it to move
  through occupied squares
  and be not affected by non-shadow
  units(with magical abilities/aura/passives being exception).
Typically this status is limited
by number of moves, after which
the unit is unshadowed and returns
to its normal state.
