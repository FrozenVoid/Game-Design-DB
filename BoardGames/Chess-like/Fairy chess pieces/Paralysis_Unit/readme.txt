A paralysis unit has the passive
(or rarely manually cast) ability
to prevent movement in the range
of its effect(usually attack range),

Rules:
1.Pieces under paralysis cannot
move but retain their ability/bonus/quality
that doesn't require movement.
2.Paralysis range is usually
 equivalent to attack squares of the unit,
 but can be based on proximity(e.g. 1sq).
