An exchange unit is capable
of 'trading places' with another
pieces(usually allied),
which results in pieces exchanging
their locations.

Usually the exchange range is 
unlimited but various restrictions
on piece-type and location(
e.g. same color/line/diagonal of squares)
can reduce exchange range with enemy
pieces.

Variations:
1.Cooldown exchange:
Exchange unit cannot exchange places
with another pieces after
 N moves from exchange move.
 
2.One-time exchange:
Exchange unit 
disappears/dies/explodes after
exchange, allowing the other piece
to escape some situation.

3.Trade exchange:
Exchange unit and exchanged
 enemy piece switch sides.

4.Allied exchange:
Limited to allied units only,
usually with unlimited range.
