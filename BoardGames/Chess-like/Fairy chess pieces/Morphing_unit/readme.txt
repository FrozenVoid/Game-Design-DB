A morphing unit(or a piece
under 'Morph' spell),
is placed in stasis for N moves
after which it morphs into
a selected piece type.

Variations:
1.Spell:
A normal piece is placed
into morphing state by spell
which can be cancelled or countered.

2.Capture-morph:
Unit morphs into a piece-type
of captured unit, usually with
a shorter morph time.

3.Temporary morphing:
The unit reverts to its default
state after N moves in morphed form
and must enter morphing stasis
to regain its 'morphed form'.

4.Staged-morph:
Unit can morph into several
 levels of same piece-type,
 gaining extra abilities/powers
 with each stage.
