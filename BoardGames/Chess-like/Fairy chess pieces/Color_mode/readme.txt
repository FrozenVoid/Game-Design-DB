that piece transforms to one
of its two forms(mode) dependent
if the square color equal to 
 piece color.

If the mode doesn't change the 
piece type its called
"Square-color bonus/penalty"

If there more piece types
 the process is "Color-change mutation"
 where change of color
 advances to next piece type
 for the unit in square.
