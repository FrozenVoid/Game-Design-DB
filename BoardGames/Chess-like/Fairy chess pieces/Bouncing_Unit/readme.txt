a bouncing unit(e.g. bishop) has
a secondary move when encountering
and obstacle(a board edge,
occupied square) to continue its
path as if it was mirrored
 with the board split on the bounce square..
(Usually the movement continues
 90 degrees to the bounce direction,)
 
 
 Bounces can be limited by:
 1.Total squares traveled:
 usually the size of board length.
 2.Number of bounces:
 typically 1-3 bounces max.
 3.By charges kept on the unit stats,
 increased/decreased by bonuses
 gained during unit use.
