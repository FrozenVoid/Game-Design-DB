Obstacle units are pieces that
cannot be captured or targeted
that serve as mobile obstacles
(occupied non-targetable squares).
Usually they cannot use abilities
or capture units(as this would be overpowered).

To counter-balance such units they
usually have a limited movement range
or cooldown for N moves per move.
