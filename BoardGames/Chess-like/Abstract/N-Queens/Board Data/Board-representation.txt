N queens board can be represented as 1D array of 
Queens's Rows.
 Each cell address[i] is the Column and its value is the Row.
 Since there needs to be N queens per NxN board
 (1 queen per Column) the problem reduces to
 determining the Row number for each array cell.
Diagonals can be checked by substracting/adding 
the "height" difference of two cells addresses
(making their rows of equal "height" so they 
could be checked at once(equalize diagonals right/left and check.).
Checking  Row collision is simply finding equal row numbers.
