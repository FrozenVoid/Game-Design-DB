A rotation move allows the player
with control of an abstract
 NxN square to rotate it at will,
which moves pieces to new locations
in the square borders.

Control can be determined by majority
of pieces or their combined 'weight score'
in some variants:e.g. pieces
on own-color squares count twice as much .
