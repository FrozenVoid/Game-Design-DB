A time bonus applies to item use independent of its attributes
or charge-systems(that apply to temporary use patterns):
The system is similar to skill-use upgrades(where use of skill
upgrades its attributes).

Several types of upgrades are common:
1.Item gains levels with use, unlocking new abilities/techniques/skills
 that are item-bound and require item use to upgrade.
2.Item gains new attributes with proportional levels it gains.
3.Item attributes are upgraded with use(permanently, without level bounds)
4.Item mutation: item visual appearance/class upgrades with levels of use.
