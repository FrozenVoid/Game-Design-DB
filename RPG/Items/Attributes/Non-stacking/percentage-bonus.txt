A non-stacking percentage bonus applies each attribute
separately as if modifiers were multiplied independently.
Example(stacking,additive): 
4 items each with +5% fire resistance grant 20%(4*5) resistance.
Example(non-stacking,multiplicative):
4 items each with +5% fire resistance grant
100-0.95^4=18.5% fire resistance,each reducing fire by 5%

the second system advantages:
1.Scales better for smaller modifiers(1% applies to current step)
2.restricts scale for big modifiers(two 50% items grant 75%)
