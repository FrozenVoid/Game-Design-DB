In Skill-Use-Leveling system, each skill/spell has an expirience 
bar that defines its current level progress(for each level N<>N+1)
The expirience is gained by using the skill or triggering its use
(for random chance/trait-type/passive skill) in some situation.
This system replaces "Skill Points" by allowing each skill to be 
independetly upgraded, with intuitive "Use->Skill Expirience" 
mechanic that is more realistic than arbitrary skill allocation.
Unlocking new skills: usually a combination of the following
A.Nth level of pre-required skill is reached 
B.an object(e.g. spellbook, shrine, NPC trainer) is activated 
granting access to skill.

Benefits:
Highly intuitive, no pre-planned "Skill Build" allocation needed.
Variety of game styles, with more diverse skills and less 
specialization(i.e. single skill builds don't exist in principle).
Drawbacks:
The system doesn't have much build diversity vs limited point 
pools(gained by leveling or pre-allocation), since it allows
 to maximize all unlocked skills(with unlocking 
 new skills being the main  level-gating mechanism).
