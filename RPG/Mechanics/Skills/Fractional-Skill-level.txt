Fractional skill level is form of skill-use-leveling system
without discrete levels. Each level insted is represented by
a floating point number(e.g. skill_level=10.203)
where expirience granted by skill use changes the skill_level
(usually combined with https://github.com/FrozenVoid/Game-Design-DB/blob/main/RPG/Stats/Expirience/Interval-expirience.txt as interval 0.0-1.0 is most precise in floating point )
to add exp with formula type similar to:
  skill_level+=gained_base_exp/current_skill_level;
Example:
Character cast level 8.110 spell Firebolt(+1.0exp per cast),
getting 1/8.110 exp to 8.110+1/8.110= upgrade to level 8.233
