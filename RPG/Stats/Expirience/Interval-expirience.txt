Interval expirience system:
Character Level=C
Exp=E
Interval = 100*1.1^C 
Gained Exp= (E/C) //divided by character level(1<>N)
Expirience in interval system is calculated as percentage
 of expirience before gaining a level: you cannot 
 lose levels(expirience below 0 doesn't change) or 
 gain multiple levels in this system, with gaining 
 100%+ exp of required interval advanced to next level
  and resets exp to zero.

Every level interval C to C+1 is treated as (0% to 100%) expirience
 fill bar from 0 to (100*1.1^C), with actions giving E=(1/C)*exp_gain.
Example:
Level 6 character performs action giving 20 exp.
This translates to (1/6)*20=3.33exp(0.0188 of interval) 
where level 6-7 interval requires
100*1.1^6= 	177.1561 exp points to reach level 7.
At level 12 the same 20 points will be (1/12)*20
=1.66 exp(0.005 of interval) in an interval
 length of 	313.84exp points.
 At level 60 the same 20 point will be 20/60 or
  0.33exp in  interval where exp bar length
 of 100*1.1^60=30448 exp, which is (0.00001083 of interval).
